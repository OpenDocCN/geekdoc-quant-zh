The rapidly growing domain of Algorithmic trading and Quantitative trading are demanding skilled individuals. This blog explains how EPAT is preparing quants for the present and future by bridging the void.

This blog covers:

*   工作和机会来了——我不骗你！
*   如果有工作，合适的人选在哪里？
*   [工作、职业和缺失因素‘X’](#careers)

The world of trading has evolved in perhaps one of the swiftest growths in any industry continually developing in infrastructure and innovation. [Algorithmic Trading](https://blog.quantinsti.com/need-know-algorithmic-trading/) has spread its wings in this era and [High-Frequency Trading](https://blog.quantinsti.com/hft-infographic/) is also very popular today.

And it is important that we realize the importance of staying up-to-date and ready to **grab those opportunities**.

While this is a time where I’d say, there is tremendous competition when it comes to jobs and careers. There is a rise of some remarkable opportunities which has captivated the global scenario.

While some have been quick to gain the [necessary skills](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/these-skills-will-help-you-master-algorithmic-trading-3448521.html) and adapt, some haven’t been so ‘lucky’.

## 在交易中拥抱和融入技术

There are some terrific changes occurring in the markets globally that are sculpting the way for technology and its use in trading, be it technological advancement or implementation of laws and [regulations](https://blog.quantinsti.com/algo-trading-regulations-eu/) pertaining to Trading.

In a [recent report](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-03/citigroup-forms-new-lab-for-traders-to-code-and-coders-to-trade), it was stated that **Citigroup Inc.** is teaching its traders how to code, and its coders how to trade through their very own coding labs - Markets Acceleration Lab, citing the need for traders to add new skills to their arsenal as more activity moves towards the electronic trading channel.

- said Deirdre Dunn, the bank’s regional head of markets for North America

**Man Group Plc.**, the London-listed firm, uses technology like [machine learning for trading](https://quantra.quantinsti.com/course/introduction-to-machine-learning-for-trading) $6-7 trillion a year and has reportedly used quantitative techniques on about two-thirds of its assets.  [Last year](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-19/man-cio-says-managers-kicking-and-screaming-in-shift-to-quant), Sandy Rattray, (Chief Investment Officer, Man Group Plc.) said:

> “你可以抗议并封锁所有街道，就像他们在欧洲经常做的那样，或者你可以说，‘我到底该如何应对这种变化’，然后继续前进，融入这些新技术。”

Similarly, the role of Sentiment Analysis and Natural Language Processing cannot be ignored, as [this article](http://www.forbesindia.com/blog/technology,%20finance/how-to-assess-twitters-impact-on-financial-markets/) explains.

Hedge funds have been hiring scientists and adopting quant strategies. This explains the necessity and urgency of utilising the opportunity and gaining those essential skills.

## 工作和机会来了——我不骗你！

Following are some eye-opening revelations from some renowned names that should be proof enough.

> “算法很难将信号与噪音分开。你仍然需要一个人来介入

- Prof Chyng Wen Tee, Singapore Management University’s Lee Kong Chian School of Business.<sup>[[1](https://www.ft.com/content/6918ff26-70e3-11e9-bf5c-6eeb837566c5)]</sup>

> "发现、沟通和管理风险是让毕业生为各行各业做好准备的技能."

- Antoine Jacquier, the director of the MSc in mathematics and finance at Imperial College London. <sup>[[2](https://www.ft.com/content/6918ff26-70e3-11e9-bf5c-6eeb837566c5)]</sup>

> “与此同时，在欧洲，金融危机后出台的监管规定，让拥有技术和法律知识的学生成为一种宝贵的资产”

- Olivier Bossard, executive director of the MSc Finance programme at HEC Paris business school.<sup>[[3](https://www.ft.com/content/6c7001ec-70e3-11e9-bf5c-6eeb837566c5)]</sup>

Following is the highlighted text from Axel Pierron’s research [Workforce of the Future: Transplanting Technology Skill Sets to the Capital Markets](http://www.opimas.com/research/472/detail/) (he is the co-founder and managing director of Opimas) that says:
![opimas-quote](img/97d6c5d750be19efe8e64be2052ab14a.png)

He also added that by 2030, 66,000 jobs will be created in emerging technologies and data science.

These technology amalgamated domains require skilled hands to mould their rise, to train, to support and to evolve them. Which is in turn pushing corporates and tech giants towards hunting for skilled and talented individuals who are technology-driven, or market experts, leading to a rise in jobs.

Moreover, the Retail Algo Trading space in India is on the rise. Individual traders, traders from retail trading, commodities are finding a huge space clubbed with opportunities. With people also opting for [setting up their own Algorithmic Trading desks](https://blog.quantinsti.com/steps-setting-algorithmic-trading-desk/), and services pertaining to Algorithmic Trading. The ease of access to technology has also made trading for individuals a very lucrative option.

## 如果有工作，合适的人选在哪里？

A simple [google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=quant+jobs&rlz=1C1GCEU_enIN820IN821&source=lnms&tbm=nws&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiiw8jjk4LjAhXSfysKHdVlCLUQ_AUIECgB&biw=1920&bih=937) reveals numerous Quant jobs in India.
![jobs-quant](img/cacb18141d314ea0c9947e8ca7b4c9cb.png)
And it isn’t limited to India, in various countries, you’ll see such rising requirements for quants globally. As reported by [BusinessInsider](https://www.businessinsider.in/bankers-are-rushing-to-take-oxford-universitys-fintech-courses-before-robots-take-their-jobs/articleshow/70042014.cms),

> “算法交易预计每年增长 11%，到 2024 年将达到 190 亿美元”。

According to Finance Magnates,

> "在算法市场应用中，股票市场部分有望呈现最高的增长率."

All of this is promising that the [future of algorithmic trading](https://blog.quantinsti.com/growth-future-algorithmic-trading/) seems pretty bright.

Following is [a list](https://www.quantinsti.com/quant-jobs) of just some of the job roles that are prevalent in the Algorithmic Trading and Quantitative Trading domain along with estimated salary figures.

![career-opportunities](img/0122fd0a13f9da780308fc718f902c38.png)

More content: [**How Much Salary Does a Quant Earn?**](https://blog.quantinsti.com/salary-quants-really-earn/)

This indicates that there are indeed the right opportunities for the right skilled and promising candidates.

If this [recent survey](https://news.efinancialcareers.com/fr-en/3001191/best-jobs-in-banking) of the best jobs in banking is to be believed, Quantitative Trading jobs ranks only second in their survey, which is quite amazing.

![work-contentment-survey](img/55f1e0659fbcdcf49351fef740c54c3f.png)

So, let me get this straight. There are desirable jobs and opportunities being created, while some already exist. **Interesting**.

Now, what could be the reason that they're not getting grabbed as fast?
**It is all about the skills.**

## 工作、职业和缺失因素“X”

There is an increasing demand for Quants with tech skills, especially those with programming and AI skills. As a result, we have observed that there are even ‘speciality’ courses popping up every now and then for training quants, and for teaching skills essential to the domain.

People are eager and they jump on to just any course without looking at the curriculum and if at all that course is worth the money.

What needs to be understood that there is a need, a requirement in the domain of algorithmic trading and quantitative trading, and there is a void of [skilled individuals](https://blog.quantinsti.com/top-skills-nailing-quant-trader-interview/) that are forming faster than what the industry can compensate for.

The industry is growing too fast, and the talent to suffice this need is limited and slow. Many are not aware of the underlying career opportunities that await them.
**Skills are that ‘X’ factor.**
In this month, Python is ranking #3 among the top-most programming language on the [TIOBE Index](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/). It is also worth noting that Python ranks at #4 on the [StackOverflow 2019 survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#technology).

About a year ago, [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-14/citi-wants-analysts-to-add-python-to-list-of-languages-on-resume) reported that Citibank Inc. made it necessary for its employees to learn Python. Now, this makes you wonder, looking at this,

*What if your employer, deeming the need of the hour, puts up the same policy?
Wouldn’t it help to be ready?*

In recent news, [WorldQuant](https://www.businessinsider.in/7-billion-hedge-fund-worldquant-hosted-a-competition-for-women-quants-now-its-hiring-50-of-the-contestants-as-research-consultants-/articleshow/69777098.cms) hosted the Women Who Quant competition in collaboration with advocacy groups and has now moved on to hiring 50 of them as research consultants.

This [insightful report](https://www.phaidoninternational.com/industryinsights/quantitative-finance-year-in-review-2019-97920124739) Quantitative Finance Year In Review - 2019 quotes the following:

*   R&D 对电子交易进行了大量投资。
*   投资银行正专注于统计建模和开发，利用机器学习和统计分析来构建算法。
*   拥有 HFT 或市场微观结构研究经验、能够构建最佳执行算法的候选人将被聘用
*   最重要的语言——c++和 Python
*   数据和研究的主要编程语言——Python
*   最受欢迎的技能——机器学习技术和数据处理
*   按需知识市场微观结构和算法执行模型的开发和研究；以及对金融的深刻理解

But to gain these skills, one must be well versed with the knowledge of trading, or have experience of the markets or must be technology-oriented (eg. having Programming skills). These skills can be picked up based on your career interests and your domain of expertise. >

## 让学习成为一种体验

People resort to various means of learning. Today you have the YouTube, ebooks, [self-learning portals](https://quantra.quantinsti.com/), forums, communities, and whatnot.

There is also a question of reliability and dependability on such courses that demand huge fees. One should thoroughly check if the institutes are accredited, certified, or have associations with some reputed bodies.

Some are freely available while others offer some serious premium content at affordable rates. And learning from apps seems to have become the “thing” nowadays.

This begs the question:**Are classroom lectures passe?**
Well, the authentic classroom experience is a rare find as the education model has changed to quite some extent when it comes to courses for training and certifications. Many classrooms simply exist on the cloud devoid of any support mechanism and lack the human interaction that we are used to experiencing.

Learners often complain that the curriculum lacks, or what was presented before buying the course isn’t what they got. Some times, the curriculum isn't up to the mark and one might end up missing learning a good chunk.

With learning, follow countless questions. But in the automated courses, who answers them when immediately required? In a few cases, queries are rarely addressed.

In limited or subscription-based models/courses one can’t go back to the courses to revise and keep up with the rapidly changing tech and trends.
**So, how does one succeed?**

## 赋予思想力量

The best method for learning is to Learning by Doing. One can specialize in a strategy/asset class through project work and with hands-on coding, paper trading knowledge, use of Excel for Data Analysis one grasps the basics of trading.

[QuantInsti](https://www.quantinsti.com/) is a pioneer Algorithmic Trading Research and Training Institute, conducting professional programmes in this rapidly growing domain and we are associated with [CPD certification](https://cpduk.co.uk/).

Over the decade of our existence, we have trained and certified some brilliant individuals from various domains of Mathematics, Statistics, Core sciences, Computer science, Engineering, Operations, Research, Business administration, Finance & Economics.

Here’s a breakdown of our audience and their professions:![audience--profession](img/435b27dffa0ec444b7599f0b6fe11ced.png)And here’s a breakdown of their domain of expertise![audience-education](img/96efa06a7ed2b0dc84c36d9daf4d6bb8.png)This is directly opposed to the standard beliefs that only Traders can learn Algorithmic Trading.

Almost half of our audience has an engineering or a technical background.
**Surprised yet?**

## 优秀是关键

**How can you excel?**

Expert guidance and mentorship are required from people who are from the domain and have a thorough experience, know-how and know the ins and outs of it. These are the right people who would guide you and shape your career. But although it sounds good, one must agree that it is very tough to grab hold of industry practitioners and market makers.

Adapting to, or learning about the field of Algo Trading requires close assistance and demands mentorship.

At QuantInsti, we realised the need for providing the power to individuals to tap into this massive spurt of Algo Trading. And that gave rise to the [Executive Programme in Algorithmic Trading (EPAT](https://www.quantinsti.com/)<sup>[®](https://www.quantinsti.com/)</sup>[)](https://www.quantinsti.com/).

Industry Experts, Stalwarts, Academicians, Traders and Market Practitioners are onboard [our faculty](https://www.quantinsti.com/faculty) bandwagon. Our associations with Dr. Ernest Chan, Dr. Gautam Mitra, Rajib R. Borah, Dr. Yves Hilpisch, Dr. Euan Sinclair and other eminent personalities open up a global opportunity for all participants and also entails them to exclusive guest lectures and events.

*   **个人交易者**可以在导师的指导下创造新的交易策略，从数据提供商和经纪人那里受益，并学会将你的策略运用到实际市场中。
*   **求职者**可以从 100 多个就业机会中受益，因为我们为他们提供了展示量化技能的完美平台。
*   **商界领袖、企业家和有志之士**可以了解如何建立自己的 Algo 交易平台，或与企业合作雇佣自己的团队，并通过专门的校友小组与其他企业家建立联系。也鼓励建立自己的交易平台。

We not only support learning by supporting some remarkable initiatives like the **FTS Eligibility**, but we also encourage students to be a part of this domain by supporting educational loans, providing student aid, as well as offering a merit-based Scholarship.

We make this is a highly valuable asset for you - high value for money and opportunity to learn along with your full-time job.

## 珍惜利益

Here are some of the benefits that you can avail as an EPATian.
![benefits-epat](img/ecd0582b85e627b75d08c162f5301c76.png)

EPAT has gone on to create [many success stories](https://blog.quantinsti.com/tag/success-stories/), helped many individuals pursue their dreams of becoming Algo Traders and continues to do so. While some have gone on to be placed successfully in the domain,  some have enhanced their learning and some have even established their very own algorithmic Trading desks.

We, at QuantInsti aim too continue to share the knowledge and awareness of this rapidly growing domain of Algorithmic trading through our [algo trading course](https://www.quantinsti.com/epat), through various educational [initiatives](https://blog.quantinsti.com/tag/announcements/), promoting learning, conducting [webinars](https://blog.quantinsti.com/tag/webinars/) and providing online resources like our [blogs](https://blog.quantinsti.com/).
