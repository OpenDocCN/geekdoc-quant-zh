- en: 'We’ve now reached the end of my trading journey. Twenty-some odd years in the
    making, you’ve seen some extreme downs, some extreme highs, and a lot of time
    spent in between both floundering around. First and foremost, I hope this book
    serves as a warning to all the new traders out there. Learn from my experience:'

  zh: 我们现在已经走到了我交易旅程的尽头。经历了二十多年的历程，你们见证了一些极端的低谷、一些极端的高峰，以及在两者之间徘徊的很多时光。首先，我希望这本书能成为所有新交易者的警示。请从我的经验中学习：
- en: Trading is tough. Exceedingly tough. Part-time folks trading from their home
    are up against professionals. The professionals are really great at taking your
    money.

  zh: 交易是困难的，极其困难。兼职交易者在家交易时，面临的是专业人士的竞争。这些专业人士真的很擅长夺取你的钱。
- en: There is no “Holy Grail” out there—no magic trading strategy that you can buy
    for $100, $1,000, or even $10,000\. There are decent ones for sale, but none is
    perfect.

  zh: 外面没有“圣杯”——没有可以花$100、$1,000甚至$10,000买到的魔法交易策略。确实有一些不错的策略可供出售，但没有一个是完美的。
- en: Where there is potential reward, there is potential risk. The results equity
    curve might only show the reward side of the equation, but remember that risk
    is always there—it just may be hidden.

  zh: 获取利润的最佳途径是找到适合你自己的交易策略，满足你所有目标和期望的策略。只需记住，不要期望这个过程会很简单。
- en: I learned all of these lessons, and many more, before I really understood how
    to trade. Even today, I still struggle. No trading strategy lasts forever, and
    I find myself constantly reinventing my trading, and creating new strategies,
    in an attempt to stay ahead of the pack. If I relax for a while, I inevitably
    find my performance suffers.

  zh: 在我真正理解如何交易之前，我学到了所有这些教训，以及更多。即使到今天，我仍然在挣扎。没有任何交易策略能够永恒，我发现自己不断地重新发明交易，并创建新策略，以试图保持领先。如果我放松一段时间，我不可避免地会发现我的表现下降。
- en: 'The majority of this book has focused on developing trading strategies. While
    I certainly value the contribution of trading psychology and position sizing and
    money management, I view them as icing on the cake, with the trading strategy
    as the cake. I look at trading this way for two reasons:'

  zh: 本书的主要内容集中在开发交易策略上。虽然我当然重视交易心理学、头寸规模和资金管理的贡献，但我把它们视为点缀，而交易策略则是主菜。我之所以这样看待交易有两个原因：
- en: All the positive trading psychology in the world will not make you profitable
    if your strategy is a loser. Positive thinking, detailed journaling, breathing
    exercises to calm your mind, and all other mental-type activities are great, but
    they still do not take the place of a solid strategy. Many people, and many trading
    psychology coaches out there, seem to think that having the proper mind-set ensures
    profits. It is just not true.

  zh: 即使是世界上所有积极的交易心理学，如果你的策略是失败的，也不会让你盈利。积极的思维、详细的记录、呼吸练习来平静你的心灵，以及所有其他心理活动都是很好的，但仍然无法替代一个扎实的策略。许多人，以及许多交易心理教练，似乎认为拥有正确的心态可以确保盈利。这根本不是真的。
- en: 'Proper position sizing and money management are important if you have a winning
    strategy, but conversely if you have a losing strategy, no position sizing or
    money management method will ever make you profitable. It might help you burn
    through your account more slowly, but a losing strategy is a losing strategy,
    no matter how you dress it up. Just think of trading like casino gambling—the
    house wins because it has an edge, and gamblers lose because they don’t have an
    edge. Changing bet sizes doesn’t alter the irrefutable fact: without an edge,
    eventually you will lose.'

  zh: 如果你有一个成功的策略，合适的头寸规模和资金管理非常重要；但反过来，如果你有一个失败的策略，无论你采用什么头寸规模或资金管理方法，都不可能让你盈利。它可能会帮助你更慢地耗尽账户，但失败的策略就是失败的策略，无论你如何包装它。把交易看作赌场赌博——赌场赢，因为它有优势，赌徒输，因为他们没有优势。改变赌注大小并不会改变这个不可辩驳的事实：没有优势，最终你会输。
- en: For long-term success, you really need to find a winning strategy. This entails
    a lot of “grunt” work—finding ideas, testing them, refining them, and hopefully
    eventually trading them. A few years ago, I kept track of my trading strategy
    development. I found out that I had to test about 100 to 200 trading ideas before
    I found something worth trading with my own money. Most people would likely abandon
    trading long before testing 100 ideas. Others would say, “Yes, it takes Kevin
    100 ideas, but he is a dullard. I am much smarter, so it will only take me less
    than 10 ideas.” Those same people, unfortunately, usually take shortcuts or cheat
    to get what appears to be an acceptable trading system. Shortcut takers, in the
    long run, usually lose.

  zh: 要获得长期成功，你真的需要找到一个成功的策略。这需要大量的“辛苦”工作——寻找想法、测试它们、完善它们，并希望最终能够交易它们。几年前，我记录了我的交易策略开发过程。我发现我必须测试大约100到200个交易想法，才能找到值得用自己的钱交易的东西。大多数人可能会在测试100个想法之前就放弃交易。其他人会说：“是的，凯文需要100个想法，但他很笨。我聪明得多，所以我只需要不到10个想法。”不幸的是，这些人通常会走捷径或作弊，以获得看似可接受的交易系统。从长远来看，走捷径的人通常会失败。
- en: In the last sections of this book, I put everything together, and walked you
    through the development of two trading strategies for the euro currency futures.
    As of this writing, I am trading these with my own money, but I keep a close eye
    on their performance. In the long term, they hopefully will succeed, and as they
    do, I’ll increase my position size accordingly. If they do not succeed, then I’ll
    eventually swap them out with other strategies. Although I hope that every strategy
    I create does well, I also know that is not always the case. Surely, the performance
    of these two euro strategies so far bears that out. They are currently making
    money but underperforming, and maybe they will continue to do so, or maybe they
    will return to their long-term averages. One never knows, so I usually prepare
    for the worst, and hope for the best. Many times, the end result is somewhere
    in between.

  zh: 在本书的最后几章中，我将所有内容结合在一起，并带你走过两个欧元期货交易策略的开发过程。截至目前，我正在用自己的钱进行交易，但我密切关注它们的表现。从长期来看，它们希望能成功，随着成功，我会相应增加头寸。如果它们不成功，那么我最终会用其他策略替换掉它们。虽然我希望我创造的每个策略都能表现良好，但我也知道这并不总是如此。到目前为止，这两个欧元策略的表现确实印证了这一点。它们目前在盈利，但表现不佳，也许会继续如此，或者可能会回到它们的长期平均水平。人们永远无法预知，所以我通常会为最坏的情况做准备，同时期待最好的结果。很多时候，最终结果就在两者之间。
- en: 'In closing, I’ll leave you with one thought: if you put your mind to becoming
    a good trader and follow that up with proper effort, you can be successful. I
    am living proof of that, although hopefully your journey will not take as long
    as mine did. But, to succeed long term, plan on dedicating a lot of time, effort,
    and money to the cause. Trading is like anything else good in life; if it is good,
    it is worth working for. Don’t be tempted by those offering shortcuts, easy fixes,
    magic formulas, or Holy Grail systems. Those folks will only sidetrack and derail
    your effort. Put the time in, follow an approach that other successful traders
    use, and you’ll be much better off. I wished I had taken that approach back in
    the late 1980s, when I first learned about futures trading from the Cowboy Trader.'

  zh: 最后，我想留给你一个想法：如果你下定决心成为一名优秀的交易者，并付出适当的努力，你可以获得成功。我就是活生生的例证，尽管希望你的旅程不会像我一样漫长。但是，要想长期成功，计划好投入大量的时间、精力和金钱。交易就像生活中的其他美好事物；如果它好，就值得去努力。不要被那些提供捷径、简单解决方案、魔法公式或“圣杯”系统的人所诱惑。这些人只会让你偏离轨道，破坏你的努力。投入时间，遵循其他成功交易者使用的方法，你会过得好得多。我希望在1980年代末第一次从牛仔交易员那里了解到期货交易时，我能采取这样的做法。
