    a formula to the price data of a security.** Price data includes any combination
    of the open, high, low or close over a period of time. Some indicators may use
    only the closing prices, while others incorporate [volume](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:glossary_v#volume

    "chart_school:glossary_v")和未平仓合约量纳入其公式中。价格数据输入到公式中，产生一个数据点。'
- en: For example, the average of 3 closing prices is one data point [ (41+43+43)
    / 3 = 42.33 ]. However, one data point does not offer much information and does
    not an indicator make. A series of data points over a period of time is required
    to create valid reference points to enable analysis. By creating a time series
    of data points, a comparison can be made between present and past levels. For
    analysis purposes, technical indicators are usually shown in a graphical form
    above or below a security's price chart. Once shown in graphical form, an indicator
    can then be compared with the corresponding price chart of the security. Sometimes
    indicators are plotted on top of the price plot for a more direct comparison.

- en: Many leading indicators come in the form of momentum oscillators. **Generally
    speaking, momentum measures the rate-of-change of a security's price.** As the
    price of a security rises, price momentum increases. The faster the security rises
    (the greater the period-over-period price change), the larger the increase in
    momentum. Once this rise begins to slow, momentum will also slow. As a security
    begins to trade flat, momentum starts to actually decline from previous high levels.
    However, declining momentum in the face of sideways trading is not always a bearish
    signal. It simply means that momentum is returning to a more median level.

    (*a momentum indicator*) compares the average price change of the advancing periods
    with the average change of the declining periods.** On the IBM chart, RSI advanced
    from October to the end of November. During this period, the stock advanced from
    the upper 60s to the low 80s. When the stock traded sideways in the first half
    of December, RSI dropped rather sharply (blue lines). This consolidation in the
    stock was quite normal and actually healthy. From these lofty levels (near 70),
    flat price action would be expected to cause a decline in RSI (and momentum).
    If RSI were trading around 50 and the stock began to trade flat, the indicator
    would not be expected to decline. The green lines on the chart mark a period of
    sideways trading in the stock and in RSI. RSI started from a relatively median
    level, around 50\. The subsequent flat price action in the stock also produced
    relatively flat price action in the indicator and it remains around 50\.

    for entry and exit is the main benefit**. Leading indicators generate more signals
    and allow more opportunities to trade. Early signals can also act to forewarn
    against a potential strength or weakness. Because they generate more signals,
    leading indicators are best used in trading markets. These indicators can be used
    in trending markets, but usually *with* the major trend, *not against* it. In
    a market that is trending up, the best use is to help identify oversold conditions
    for buying opportunities. In a market that is trending down, leading indicators
    can help identify overbought situations for selling opportunities.

    a signal. (Note: The Stochastic Oscillator is usually plotted with a 3-day simple

    third and final confirmation. However, this can be a more reliable signal and
    help to avoid whipsaws and false signals. It is true that waiting for the third
    signal will reduce profits, but it can also help reduce risk.

- en: '[Chaikin Money Flow](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:glossary_c#chaikin_money_flow_cmf
    "chart_school:glossary_c") is an example of a centered oscillator that places
    importance on crosses above and below the centerline. Divergences, overbought
    levels, and oversold levels are all secondary to the absolute level of the indicator.
    The direction of the oscillator''s movement is important but needs to be placed
    in the context of the absolute level. The longer the oscillator is above zero,
    the more evidence of accumulation. The longer the oscillator is below zero, the
    more evidence of distribution. **Hence, Chaikin Money Flow is considered to be
    bullish when the oscillator is trading above zero and bearish when trading below
    zero.**'

- en: On the IBM chart, Chaikin Money Flow began to turn down in July. At this time,
    the stock was declining with the market and the decline in the oscillator was
    normal. However, in the second half of August, concerns began to grow when the
    oscillator failed to continue up with the stock and fell below zero. As the stock
    advanced further, Chaikin Money Flow continued to deteriorate. This served as
    a signal that something was amiss.

- en: Banded oscillators are best used to identify overbought and oversold conditions.
    However, overbought is not meant to act as a sell signal, and oversold is not
    meant to act as a buy signal. Overbought and oversold situations serve as an alert
    that conditions are reaching extreme levels and close attention should be paid
    to the price action and other indicators.

  zh: 带状振荡器最适合用于识别超买和超卖条件。然而，超买并不意味着要作为卖出信号，超卖也不意味着要作为买入信号。超买和超卖情况仅作为警示，表明条件正在达到极端水平，应密切关注价格走势和其他指标。
- en: To improve the robustness of oscillator signals, traders can look for multiple
    signals. The criteria for a buy or sell signal could depend on three separate
    yet confirming signals. A buy signal might be generated with an oversold reading,
    positive divergence, and bullish moving average crossover. Conversely, a sell
    signal might be generated from a negative divergence, bearish moving average crossover,
    and bearish centerline crossover.

  zh: 为了提高振荡器信号的稳健性，交易者可以寻找多个信号。买入或卖出信号的标准可能取决于三个独立但相互确认的信号。买入信号可能是由超卖读数、正向分歧和牛市移动平均线交叉产生的。相反，卖出信号可能是由负向分歧、熊市移动平均线交叉和熊市中线交叉产生的。
- en: Traditional chart pattern analysis can also be applied to oscillators. This
    is a bit trickier but can help to identify the strength behind an oscillator's
    move. Looking for higher highs or lower lows can help confirm the previous analysis.
    A trend line breakout can signal that a change in the direction of the momentum
    is imminent.

- en: It is dangerous to trade an oscillator signal against the major trend of the
    market. In bull moves, it is best to look for buying opportunities through oversold
    signals, positive divergences, bullish moving average crossovers and bullish centerline
    crossovers. In bear moves, it is best to look for selling opportunities through
    overbought signals, negative divergences, bearish moving average crossovers and
    bearish centerline crossovers.

  zh: 在市场的主要趋势相反的情况下交易振荡器信号是危险的。在牛市中，最好通过超卖信号、正向分歧、牛市移动平均线交叉和牛市中线交叉寻找买入机会。在熊市中，最好通过超买信号、负向分歧、熊市移动平均线交叉和熊市中线交叉寻找卖出机会。
- en: And finally, oscillators are most effective when used in conjunction with pattern
    analysis, support/resistance identification, trend identification and other technical
    analysis tools. By being aware of the broader picture, oscillator signals can
    be put into context. It is important to identify the current trend or even to
    ascertain if the security is trending at all. Oscillator readings and signals
    can have different meanings in differing circumstances. By using other analysis
    techniques in conjunction with oscillator reading, the chances of success can
    be greatly enhanced.
