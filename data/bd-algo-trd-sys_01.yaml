- en: It was 1989, and I was California dreamin’. Actually I wasn’t dreaming, I was
    already in California, living a young single man’s dream. A year or so out of
    college, I was residing in sunny Manhattan Beach, California, with a small apartment
    three blocks from the soft white sand so wonderful that they used it to help create
    Waikiki Beach in Hawaii. I had graduated the year before, summa cum laude, with
    a bachelor’s degree in aerospace engineering from the University of Michigan,
    a top-tier engineering school. Then I had turned my back on Massachusetts Institute
    of Technology (MIT), California Institute of Technology (Cal Tech), Stanford University,
    Purdue University, and Michigan, all of whom had accepted me in their aerospace
    master’s degree program. I turned down those great schools to live and work in
    sunny California, a lifelong dream.

  zh: 那是1989年，我在加州追梦。其实我并不在做梦，我已经身处加州，过着年轻单身汉的梦想。大学毕业一年左右，我住在阳光明媚的曼哈顿海滩，加州，公寓距离柔软的白沙仅三个街区，那里的沙子如此美妙，以至于用于帮助创造夏威夷的威基基海滩。我在一年之前以优异的成绩毕业，获得密歇根大学的航空航天工程学士学位，这是一所顶尖的工程学校。随后，我拒绝了麻省理工学院、加州理工学院、斯坦福大学、普渡大学和密歇根州的航空航天硕士项目录取。我放弃了那些伟大的学校，以实现我在阳光明媚的加州生活和工作的终生梦想。
- en: I still remember the precise moment I made that fateful decision. On a bitterly
    cold winter’s day in Ann Arbor, Michigan, I was walking down South University
    Avenue to one of my final-semester classes. The wind was blowing so hard in my
    face that I actually leaned into the wind to see if it would keep me up. At that
    point, falling face-first onto the ice-covered sidewalk would not have been much
    worse than feeling the stinging wind in my face. What seemed like a gale-force
    wind kept me upright, and then I knew—I did not want, or need, to live where it
    was cold in the winter when aerospace engineering graduates like me were flocking
    to jobs in sunny southern California. My mind was made up. Sun and sand it was.

    beach life certainly agreed with me, but my choice of career was the wrong one.
    Sure, designing future fighter airplanes and working on secret government projects
    was fulfilling to a degree. But I just didn’t feel like it was my future. I could
    not see myself doing that kind of work for even 5 years, much less a career of

    doesn’t necessarily mean a trade should be taken. If you take every single head
    and shoulders trade you see, you will soon be broke, as shown in [Figure 1.3](#figure1-3).

    gurus, most of whom are not gurus in any sense of the word. I’d estimate that
    over 90 percent of the trading systems for sale are junk (and I am being generous
    here— the actual number might be closer to 99 percent), marketed by people who
    figured out that selling to newbie traders was far easier, and far more lucrative,
    than actually trading. The statistics you hear about 80 or 90 percent of traders
    losing money is no lie, and the reason is that trading is really, really difficult.
    I hope that by reading about my trading journey and later learning about my trading
    process, you will get a sense of how challenging it is. At the same time, you’ll
    come to realize that success in trading is possible but that there aren’t any

    trading software (in the early 1990s, trading software was not very popular and
    it was relatively expensive), I decided to create my own back-testing software,
    using Microsoft Excel and Visual Basic. I’ll spare you the details, but suffice
    it to say that I had no trouble developing terrific-looking trading systems. Creating
    nice-looking equity curves turns out to be a trivial task when you neglect commissions
    and slippage. It is also easy to do when your system has 10 variables and you
    run 1 million iterations with various combinations of those variables. Typical
    newbie mistakes, and I was repeating each one of them over and over. The only
    thing that saved me was that the results were so good, and profits were so astronomically
    high, even I did not believe them. I assumed it was bad data or my software was
    faulty, but that wasn’t the root cause. The main problem was that I was testing

    Excel和Visual Basic。我就不细说了，但可以说，我在开发出看起来很不错的交易系统时毫无困难。忽略佣金和滑点时，创建漂亮的收益曲线显得相当简单。当你的系统有10个变量并且运行100万次不同变量组合时，这也是很容易做到的。这都是典型的新手错误，而我一次又一次地犯着同样的错误。唯一拯救我的就是结果如此之好，利润高得令人难以置信，连我自己都不敢相信。我以为这是数据有问题或者我的软件有故障，但这并不是根本原因。主要问题是我测试的方法不正确。

    was *You Can’t Lose Trading Commodities* (R. F. Wiest, 1988), by Robert Wiest.
    At the time I read it in the early 1990’s, the book was already over five years
    old, and I remember its being prominently displayed in a local bookstore. I assumed
    this meant it must be a legitimate money maker to still be around after five years.
    This book was all about scale trading. The concept is that you find a commodity
    that is trading near a multiyear low, find a fundamental reason for it to go up
    in the near future, and then buy on a scale down and sell with a small profit.
    Here’s an example: let’s say wheat is currently at a 10-year low of 300 cents
    per bushel. You also hear forecasts the next wheat crop is going to be much smaller
    because of bad weather. Your analysis indicates that over the next 6 months, wheat
    is likely to go up. So you buy wheat at 300 cents, hoping to sell it at 305 cents
    ($250 profit per contract). If the price falls to 290 cents, you buy a second
    contract, hoping to sell that at 295 cents. You continue to add to your position
    every 10 cents down, with a profit target 5 cents above the corresponding entry.
    Ideally, the price will fall a bit, allowing you to buy three or more contracts,
    before it rises to 305, letting you exit with a profit on each contract. Then,
    if the price fell again, you’d just repeat the process, scaling in and scaling
    out.'

  zh: 那本暂时让我离开系统化测试交易系统的书是*你不会在商品交易中亏损*（R. F. Wiest，1988），作者是罗伯特·维斯特。当我在1990年代早期阅读这本书时，它已经出版超过五年，我记得它在当地书店显眼地展示着。我认为这意味着它一定是一个合法的赚钱书籍，能在五年后仍然存在。这本书主要讲的是规模交易。概念是找到一种接近多年低点的商品，寻找其在不久的将来会上涨的基本理由，然后分批买入，略微获利后再卖出。举个例子：假设小麦目前的价格为300美分，正处于10年来的低点。你还听到预测下一个小麦作物由于恶劣天气将大幅减产。你的分析表明，在接下来的六个月内，小麦可能会上涨。因此，你以300美分的价格买入小麦，希望在305美分时卖出（每份合约获利250美元）。如果价格跌至290美分，你再买入第二份合约，期望在295美分时卖出。你每跌10美分就增加持仓，利润目标是比相应的买入价高5美分。理想情况下，价格会稍微下跌，让你买入三份或更多的合约，然后在价格升至305时，获利退出每份合约。然后，如果价格再次下跌，你只需重复这个过程，逐步买入和卖出。
- en: The author claimed something like 90 to 95 percent wins with this method, which
    is entirely possible. But winning percentage is really meaningless. What matters
    is the return on account, and the drawdown. And, when done correctly, scale trading
    produces fairly low rates of return (10 to 20 percent), with fairly high drawdowns
    (20 percent or more). This is because you need a lot of capital to keep buying
    on the way down. If you don’t have enough capital, you won’t be able to continue
    buying. Then you won’t be able to cash in on the lucrative oscillations in price.
    Eventually, if the situation gets dire enough, you’ll be hit with a margin call,
    and your scale trading will likely abruptly end.

    inexperienced trader level. All I had to do was find commodities near multiyear
    lows and set up scales to trade them. I knew I would not be satisfied with only
    10 to 20 percent return, so I had to make some adjustments, the main one being
    trading with a much smaller than recommended account size. This worked great the

    in scale-trading winner after winner. Of course, the market slapped me around,
    and slapped me hard, for thinking this way. I don’t even recall which commodity
    was the source of pain—it might have been wheat, corn, cotton, or coffee—but one
    of my second-year scales went terribly bad. I lost all my first year’s profits,
    and most of what was left in my account. For me, the book title *You Can’t Lose

    to a losing position works with mutual funds because (1) over time, mutual funds

    like wheat (my personal favorite for the adding-to-losers strategy), the price
    doesn’t necessarily have to go up over a 5- or 10-year period. Price could stay
    depressed for a long time, leaving you with a pile of open, losing trades. Plus,
    for every wheat contract you purchase, you need extra margin, and eventually even
    small price moves become huge swings in your equity. That is what happened to

    ideas, looking at software options, determining how to do walk-forward testing
    manually. For my strategy, I decided to go with a simple X day close breakout;
    that is, if the close today is the highest close of the last X bars, then buy
    at the open of the next bar. For short entries, it was vice versa. For exits,
    I employed a simple stop based on average true range, a fixed dollar stop, a moving
    stop as profits accumulated, and a tightening stop that applied only when a big
    open profit occurred. It was a pretty simple system, but my initial results showed
    it worked well. Nothing earth shattering about this strategy’s entries or exits—I
    am sure this approach was been applied by many people before. It is just a simple
    trend-following approach, and as long as some sustained trends develop, the system
    overall will make money.

    (many people say it still is the best, and I still use it as my primary tool,
    but there are many other excellent back-test programs available on the market
    today, too). In addition to making the testing easier, I had much more faith in
    the results. The only problem was that I wanted to utilize walk-forward testing
    (discussed in great detail later), and TradeStation at the time did not support
    that feature. So I was relegated to running optimizations on TradeStation, then
    computing results and manually performing a walk-forward analysis. It was tedious
    work, but at the same time it gave me a solid sense of how walk-forward testing
    actually worked (I suggest your first walk-forward test be done manually to increase

    system was good enough. Looking at the performance of past winners, I concluded
    that I had a reasonable chance of finishing in the top three contestants, as long
    as I had an annual return of 100 percent or higher. That was actually my goal;
    it wasn’t to win the contest, since I realized that at the upper end of performance,
    luck would play a role. I could not count on luck to win the contest; all I could
    do was set myself up to be near the top. To achieve 100 percent return over the
    course of a year, I knew I had to accept a very large maximum drawdown. I decided
    I would allow around 75 percent maximum drawdown, which would be ridiculous for
    any normal trader’s account. But, as I’ll discuss in great detail later, your
    goals and expectations should be based on the situation at hand. For a trading
    contest where the only success criterion was return on account, allowing a large
    drawdown makes sense. If, however, the contest were based on return and risk (say
    the winning contestant would have the highest Calmar ratio), I would have approached
    the contest completely differently. This will be discussed in detail later, but
    for now realize the goals and objectives I set at the outset dictated every subsequent
    step in the trading development process.

    I tested over 20 to 25 different instruments. Then, upon seeing the actual performance,
    I simply selected the best performers. In other words, I optimized based on market!
    That is a big no-no for good strategy development. For my second mistake, I did
    not run any detailed correlation studies when selecting the portfolio. Rather,
    I simply guessed at what I thought the correlation should be (“Corn and the Nikkei
    Index are probably not correlated, so I can trade both.”). At the time, this seemed
    reasonable, but my experience since that time has taught me that correlations
    sometimes are different than what common sense dictates, and should always be
    examined in a portfolio situation. Even then, it is important to realize that
    even noncorrelated instruments can become correlated during market panics. Thankfully,
    in spite of my rookie development mistakes, my trading approach still succeeded.

    trend in November really helped the account take off. That is really how trend
    trading works—you can have months of flat to down performance, but catching a
    couple of trends can make your whole year. The problem, of course, is that if
    you miss the trend trade—let’s say you give up before the trend shows itself because
    of the numerous false breakout losses, or you don’t have enough money in your

    first month of 2006 was great for me. I was up about 30 percent, and I felt great
    about my chances. Of course, whenever I feel great about my trading, a drawdown
    is right around the corner. That happened in February and March and brought me
    back down to breakeven. A couple of losing trades in yen and 10-year Treasury
    notes helped bring me back down to earth.

    traded the system as planned, and I still traded only one contract for each trade.

    that I shut my trading down at the start of December. Part of this was warranted

    my eventual victory, is that that is not how I remember trading the contest years

    up until the last day. I’m sure in public webinars and writings I have said the
    same thing—that I never stopped trading just to stay in first place. Yet that
    is exactly what I did! And that disturbs me now. No, not that I ceased trading,

    me, that meant following my system, the one developed specifically to average

    ago when I started full time), I now believe it is reasonable. After all, you
    want your trading account to grow over time, and you want to draw living expenses
    from it, and at the same time you need to survive the inevitable drawdowns. It
    is nearly impossible to accomplish all three on a shoestring-sized account.

  zh: 根据我的启动资金，我必须每年获得50%到100%的回报，才能支付生活费用、税款，并略微增加我的交易账户。哇！回想起来，我意识到我真是疯狂，开始时的资金大约比我应该有的少了10倍。另一位全职交易的朋友曾告诉我，他认识的每位成功交易员在开始全职交易之前都以200万到300万美元起步。尽管这个数字听起来很疯狂（六年前我开始全职时会对此嗤之以鼻），但现在我认为这是合理的。毕竟，你希望你的交易账户随着时间的推移而增长，并希望从中提取生活费用，同时还需要应对不可避免的回撤。在资金紧张的情况下，几乎不可能同时实现这三点。

- en: When I started full-time trading in 2008, I was fortunate enough to have three
    to five years of living expenses saved up. That savings was not part of retirement,
    and was not part of my trading capital. I think those are the key issues to living
    expenses when embarking on full-time trading. Trading is stressful enough without
    worrying about where your next meal or mortgage payment is coming from. You need
    to feel secure that your expenses are covered, even if you hit a drawdown right
    from the start (which always seems to be the case for me!).

  zh: 当我在2008年开始全职交易时，我很幸运地储蓄了三到五年的生活费用。这笔储蓄不属于退休金，也不属于我的交易资本。我认为这是全职交易时生活费用的关键问题。交易本身已经足够紧张，而不必担心下顿饭或按揭款从哪里来。你需要感到安全，知道你的费用是有保障的，即使你一开始就遇到回撤（对我来说这似乎总是如此！）。

    a backup phone number for the trade desk (which you definitely should have handy,
    by the way). I mean having multiple accounts at multiple brokers, ideally having
    different clearing firms. Brokers do fail from time to time (I was a victim of
    Refco’s bankruptcy and of PFG Best’s corrupt owner), and by having multiple accounts,
    you can still trade even if one broker goes down. Since I trade multiple strategies,
    it also makes bookkeeping a bit easier, since many times I’ll dedicate one strategy
    to one specific account.

    Best腐败老板的受害者），通过拥有多个账户，即使一个经纪商出现问题，你仍然可以交易。由于我交易多种策略，这也使得记账稍微简单一些，因为我经常会将一个策略专门分配给一个特定的账户。
