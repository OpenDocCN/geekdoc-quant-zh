- en: At the heart of this ecosystem lies the distinction between exchange-traded
    options and over-the-counter (OTC) options. Exchange-traded options are standardized
    contracts that trade on regulated exchanges such as the Chicago Board Options
    Exchange (CBOE) or the International Securities Exchange (ISE). These venues provide
    an orderly market, transparent pricing, and are backed by clearinghouses which
    mitigate counterparty risk.

  zh: 历史波动性提供了对资产过去表现的洞察，但期权市场是前瞻性的，隐含波动性反映了市场对未来波动性的共识。这种前瞻性波动性影响期权合约的溢价，并影响交易者采用的策略。例如，隐含波动性的激增可能导致期权卖方的溢价增加，但也表明市场对更大价格波动的预期。
- en: Conversely, volume, the total number of shares or contracts traded in a given
    period, tells a tale of liquidity. High volume indicates a bustling marketplace
    with abundant trading activity, where orders can be executed rapidly and without
    significantly impacting the price. A liquid market is the bedrock upon which traders
    can build strategies with confidence, knowing that they can enter and exit positions
    without the fear of slippage eroding their potential gains.

    market structure. For example, a market with high volatility but low volume may
    present unique challenges, as the price can swing widely, yet the lack of liquidity
    can make it difficult for traders to execute orders at desired prices. This scenario
    can lead to a wider bid-ask spread, as market makers demand greater compensation
    for the increased risk they take on in providing liquidity.
