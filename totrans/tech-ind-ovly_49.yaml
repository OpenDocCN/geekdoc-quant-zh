- en: Developed by George C. Lane in the late 1950s, the Stochastic Oscillator is
    a momentum indicator that shows the location of the close relative to the high-low
    range over a set number of periods. According to an interview with Lane, the Stochastic
    Oscillator “doesn't follow price, it doesn't follow volume or anything like that.
    It follows the speed or the momentum of price. As a rule, the momentum changes
    direction before price.” As such, bullish and bearish divergences in the Stochastic
    Oscillator can be used to foreshadow reversals. This was the first, and most important,
    signal that Lane identified. Lane also used this oscillator to identify bull and
    bear set-ups to anticipate a future reversal. Because the Stochastic Oscillator
    is range bound, is also useful for identifying overbought and oversold levels.

- en: The Stochastic Oscillator measures the level of the close relative to the high-low
    range over a given period of time. Assume that the highest high equals 110, the
    lowest low equals 100 and the close equals 108\. The high-low range is 10, which
    is the denominator in the %K formula. The close less the lowest low equals 8,
    which is the numerator. 8 divided by 10 equals .80 or 80%. Multiply this number
    by 100 to find %K %K would equal 30 if the close was at 103 (.30 x 100). The Stochastic
    Oscillator is above 50 when the close is in the upper half of the range and below
    50 when the close is in the lower half. Low readings (below 20) indicate that
    price is near its low for the given time period. High readings (above 80) indicate
    that price is near its high for the given time period. The IBM example above shows
    three 14-day ranges (yellow areas) with the closing price at the end of the period
    (red dotted) line. The Stochastic Oscillator equals 91 when the close was at the
    top of the range. The Stochastic Oscillator equals 15 when the close was near
    the bottom of the range. The close equals 57 when the close was in the middle
    of the range.

- en: There are three versions of the Stochastic Oscillator available on SharpCharts.
    The Fast Stochastic Oscillator is based on George Lane's original formulas for
    %K and %D. %K in the fast version that appears rather choppy. %D is the 3-day
    SMA of %K. In fact, Lane used %D to generate buy or sell signals based on bullish
    and bearish divergences. Lane asserts that a %D divergence is the “only signal
    which will cause you to buy or sell.” Because %D in the Fast Stochastic Oscillator
    is used for signals, the Slow Stochastic Oscillator was introduced to reflect
    this emphasis. The Slow Stochastic Oscillator smooths %K with a 3-day SMA, which
    is exactly what %D is in the Fast Stochastic Oscillator. Notice that %K in the
    Slow Stochastic Oscillator equals %D in the Fast Stochastic Oscillator (chart
    2).

    the Stochastic Oscillator makes it easy to identify overbought and oversold levels.
    The oscillator ranges from zero to one hundred. No matter how fast a security
    advances or declines, the Stochastic Oscillator will always fluctuate within this
    range. Traditional settings use 80 as the overbought threshold and 20 as the oversold
    threshold. These levels can be adjusted to suit analytical needs and security
    characteristics. Readings above 80 for the 20-day Stochastic Oscillator would
    indicate that the underlying security was trading near the top of its 20-day high-low
    range. Readings below 20 occur when a security is trading at the low end of its
    high-low range.

- en: Before looking at some chart examples, it is important to note that overbought
    readings are not necessarily bearish. Securities can become overbought and remain
    overbought during a strong uptrend. Closing levels that are consistently near
    the top of the range indicate sustained buying pressure. In a similar vein, oversold
    readings are not necessarily bullish. Securities can also become oversold and
    remain oversold during a strong downtrend. Closing levels consistently near the
    bottom of the range indicate sustained selling pressure. It is, therefore, important
    to identify the bigger trend and trade in the direction of this trend. Look for
    occasional oversold readings in an uptrend and ignore frequent overbought readings.
    Similarly, look for occasional overbought readings in a strong downtrend and ignore
    frequent oversold readings.

    longer look-back period (20 days versus 14) and longer moving averages for smoothing
    (5 versus 3) produce a less sensitive oscillator with fewer signals. Yahoo was
    trading between 14 and 18 from July 2009 until April 2010\. Such trading ranges
    are well suited for the Stochastic Oscillator. Dips below 20 warn of oversold
    conditions that could foreshadow a bounce. Moves above 80 warn of overbought conditions
    that could foreshadow a decline. Notice how the oscillator can move above 80 and
    remain above 80 (orange highlights). Similarly, the oscillator moved below 20
    and sometimes remained below 20\. The indicator is both overbought AND strong
    when above 80\. A subsequent move below 80 is needed to signal some sort of reversal
    or failure at resistance (red dotted lines). Conversely, the oscillator is both
    oversold and weak when below 20\. A move above 20 is needed to show an actual
    upturn and successful support test (green dotted lines).

    The Full Stochastic Oscillator (20,5,5) was used to identify oversold readings.
    Overbought readings were ignored because the bigger trend was up. Trading in the
    direction of the bigger trend improves the odds. The Full Stochastic Oscillator
    moved below 20 in early September and early November. Subsequent moves back above
    20 signaled an upturn in prices (green dotted line) and continuation of the bigger

    was used to identify overbought readings to foreshadow a potential reversal. Oversold
    readings were ignored because of the bigger downtrend. The shorter look-back period
    (10 versus 14) increases the sensitivity of the oscillator for more overbought
    readings. For reference, the Full Stochastic Oscillator (20,5,5) is also shown.
    Notice that this less sensitive version did not become overbought in August, September,
    and October. It is sometimes necessary to increase sensitivity to generate signals.

    A bullish divergence forms when price records a lower low, but the Stochastic

    a bullish reversal. A bearish divergence forms when price records a higher high,
    but the Stochastic Oscillator forms a lower high. This shows less upside momentum
    that could foreshadow a bearish reversal. Once a divergence takes hold, chartists
    should look for a confirmation to signal an actual reversal. A bearish divergence
    can be confirmed with a support break on the price chart or a Stochastic Oscillator
    break below 50, which is the centerline. A bullish divergence can be confirmed
    with a resistance break on the price chart or a Stochastic Oscillator break above

    and one hundred, which makes 50 the centerline. Think of it as the 50-yard line
    in football. The offense has a higher chance of scoring when it crosses the 50-yard
    line. The defense has an edge as long as it prevents the offense from crossing
    the 50-yard line. A Stochastic Oscillator cross above 50 signals that prices are
    trading in the upper half of their high-low range for the given look-back period.
    This suggests that the cup is half full. Conversely, a cross below 50 means that
    prices are trading in the bottom half of the given look-back period. This suggests

    first is a signal line cross and/or move back above 20\. A signal line cross occurs
    when %K (black) crosses %D (red). This provides the earliest entry possible. The
    second is a move above 50, which puts prices in the upper half of the Stochastic

    80 did not provide good early signals in this case because KSS kept moving higher.
    The Stochastic Oscillator moved below 50 for the second signal and the stock broke
    support for the third signal. As KSS shows, early signals are not always clean
    and simple. Signal line crosses, moves below 80, and moves above 20 are frequent
    and prone to whipsaw. Even after KSS broke support and the Stochastic Oscillator
    moved below 50, the stock bounced back above 57 and the Stochastic Oscillator
    bounced back above 50 before the stock continued sharply lower.

    A bull set-up is basically the inverse of a bullish divergence. The underlying
    security forms a lower high, but the Stochastic Oscillator forms a higher high.
    Even though the stock could not exceed its prior high, the higher high in the
    Stochastic Oscillator shows strengthening upside momentum. The next decline is
    then expected to result in a tradable bottom. Chart 8 shows Network Appliance
    (NTAP) with a bull set-up in June 2009\. The stock formed a lower high as the
    Stochastic Oscillator forged a higher high. This higher high shows strength in
    upside momentum. Remember that this is a set-up, not a signal. The set-up foreshadows
    a tradable low in the near future. NTAP declined below its June low and the Stochastic
    Oscillator moved below 20 to become oversold. Traders could have acted when the
    Stochastic Oscillator moved above its signal line, above 20 or above 50\. Alternatively,
    NTAP subsequently broke resistance with a strong move.

    be used with securities that trend, provided the trend takes on a zigzag format.
    Pullbacks are part of uptrends that zigzag higher. Bounces are part of downtrends
    that zigzag lower. In this regard, the Stochastic Oscillator can be used to identify
    opportunities in harmony with the bigger trend.

    Should a security trade near support with an oversold Stochastic Oscillator, look

    should a security trade near resistance with an overbought Stochastic Oscillator,
    look for a break below 80 to signal a downturn and resistance failure.
