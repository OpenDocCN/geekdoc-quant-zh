- en: The Detrended Price Oscillator (DPO) is an indicator designed to remove trend
    from price and make it easier to identify cycles. DPO does not extend to the last
    date because it is based on a displaced moving average. However, alignment with
    the most recent is not an issue because DPO is not a momentum oscillator. Instead,
    DPO is used to identify cycles highs/lows and estimate cycle length.

    a 20-day simple [moving average](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_averages
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_averages") offset 11 days to the left.
    There are 10 days in front of the moving average, 1 day at the moving average
    and 9 days behind the moving average. In reality, this moving average is in the
    middle of its look-back period. Roughly half the prices used in the calculation
    are to the right and half are to the left. Chart 1 shows the S&P 500 ETF (SPY)
    with a 20-day SMA (green dotted line) and a 20-day SMA offset 11 days (pink line).
    The ending values are the same (106.84), but the pink moving average ends on October
    27th and the green moving average ends on November 11th, which is the last date
    on the chart. Also, notice how the “centered” moving average (pink) more closely
    follows the actual price plot.

- en: The Detrended Price Oscillator (DPO) measures the difference between a past
    price and a moving average. Keep in mind that DPO is itself displaced to the left.
    The indicator oscillates above/below zero as prices move above/below the displaced
    moving average. Chart 2 shows the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) with a 20-day moving average
    displaced -11 days. 20-day DPO is shown in the indicator window. Notice how DPO
    is positive when price is above the displaced moving average and negative when
    price is below the displaced moving average.

- en: Even though this indicator looks like a classic oscillator, it is not designed
    for momentum signals. The displaced moving average is set in the past and this
    is why the DPO is shown in the past. Even with this displacement, DPO peaks and
    troughs can be used to estimate cycle length. DPO filters out the longer trends
    to focus on shorter cycles. Chart 3 shows the Nasdaq 100 ETF (QQQQ) with DPO (20)
    in the indicator window. Looking at the peaks and troughs, we can see a 20-day
    cycle with the lows in early September, early October, early November and early
    December. There are roughly 20 days between these lows. The cycle missed in early
    January.

- en: It is possible to displace the Detrended Price Oscillator (DPO) with a horizontal
    shift to the right. If DPO is set at 20, then an 11-period shift is needed to
    place it in line with the most recent price. This displacement number comes from
    the formula at the top (20/2 + 1) = 11\. While shifting may seem like a good idea,
    it really defeats the purpose of this indicator, which is to identify cycles.

- en: Even with a positive displacement, DPO fluctuations do not match up well with
    prices. In the example below, the last value for DPO (20,11) is still based on
    the close 11 days ago and the value of the moving average. Notice that DPO turned
    negative as price moved below the centered moving average 11 days ago (orange
    box). DPO simply does not match current price action. In contrast to DPO, price
    has been below the 20-day EMA the last 12 days. The Percentage Price Oscillator
    (PPO) is better suited to identify overbought and oversold levels. PPO(1,20,1)
    shows the percentage difference between current price and the normal 20-day exponential
    moving average. Overbought/oversold conditions occur when prices get relatively
    far from their 20-day EMA.

- en: The Detrended Price Oscillator shows the difference between a past price and
    a simple moving average. In contrast to other price oscillators, DPO is not a
    momentum indicator. Instead, it is simply designed to identify cycles with its
    peaks and troughs. Cycles can be estimated by counting the periods between peaks
    or troughs. Users can experiment with shorter and longer DPO settings to find
    the best fit.

- en: The Detrended Price Oscillator (DPO) can be found in the indicator list on SharpCharts.
    The default parameter is 20 periods, but this can be adjusted accordingly to find
    cycles. Users can also add another parameter separated by a comma. A comma plus
    a positive number shifts the indicator to the right. DPO can be positioned above,
    below or behind the price plot. [Click here](http://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=SPY&p=D&b=5&g=0&id=p14005429311&listNum=30&a=191188211

- en: The Detrended Price Oscillator is not well suited for scans because the indicator
    is based on an offset moving average. A 20-day DPO correlates to a price 11 days
    ago, which is not practical for scans. DPO is also based on absolute levels and
    this makes it difficult for comparative purposes. A $100 stock will have a much
    wider DPO range than a $20 stock. Google traded around $590 per share in early
    January with a DPO around 21\. Intel traded around 20.5 in early January with
    a DPO around .20, which is much lower. The DPO lower because Intel is priced much
    lower than Google.
