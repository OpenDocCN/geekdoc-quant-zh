- en: Developed by Etienne Botes and Douglas Siepman, the Vortex Indicator consists
    of two oscillators that capture positive and negative trend movement. In creating
    this indicator, Botes and Seipman drew on the work of Welles Wilder and Viktor
    Schauberger, who is considered the father of implosion technology. Despite a rather
    involved formula, the indicator is quite straightforward to understand and easy
    to interpret. A bullish signal triggers when the positive trend indicator crosses
    above the negative trend indicator or a key level. A bearish signal triggers when
    the negative trend indicator crosses above the positive trend indicator or a key
    level. The Vortex Indicator is either above or below these levels, which means
    it always has a clear bullish or bearish bias.

- en: Calculation of the Vortex Indicator (VTX) can be divided into three parts. First,
    calculate the positive and negative trend movements based on the highs and lows
    of the last two periods. Positive trend movement is the distance from the current
    high to the prior low. The further the current high is from the prior low, the
    more positive the trend movement. Negative trend movement is the distance from
    the current low to the prior high. The further the current low is from the prior
    high, the more negative the trend movement. These periodic values are then summed
    based on the indicator setting, which is the usually 14 periods.

    This indicator uses the current high, current low and prior close to measure volatility.
    See the formula box below for details.

- en: The third part normalizes the positive and negative trend movements by dividing
    them by the True Range. In effect, the Vortex Indicator shows volatility-adjusted
    positive trend movement and volatility-adjusted negative trend movement. The end
    result creates two indicators that oscillate above/below 1\.

- en: The Vortex Indicator (VTX) can be used to identify the start of a trend and
    subsequently affirm trend direction. First, a simple cross of the two oscillators
    can be used to signal the start of a trend. After this crossover, the trend is
    up when +VI is above -VI and down when -VI is greater than +VI. Second, a cross
    above or below a particular level can signal the start of a trend and these levels
    can be used to affirm trend direction.

- en: The simplest signal triggers when +VI and -VI cross. The example below shows
    the Nasdaq 100 ETF (QQQ) using weekly bars and a 26-period VTX, which amounts
    to around six months. There were over a dozen crossovers in a six and a half year
    period. The yellow areas show bullish crossovers that lasted more than six months.
    This is what happens in a strong uptrend. There was also a significant bearish
    crossover in the second half of 2008\. Even though there were plenty of good signals,
    there were also whipsaws. This is simply the nature of the beast and the nature
    of indicators in general. The blue circles show periods of indecision when both
    trend indicators hovered around 1 and the S&P 500 consolidated.

- en: The second example shows Baxter (BAX) using daily charts and the 23-period VTX,
    which covers around one month. Not every crossover results in a clear trend signal.
    Notice how VTX traded in a narrow range around 1 from October to early November
    (yellow area). This marked a consolidation as prices formed a triangle. There
    were some whipsaws at the beginning of 2012 (blue circle) and then a few good
    signals later in the year. It sometimes helps to qualify a signal by waiting for
    confirmation with a move above 1\. A bullish crossover is further validated when
    +VM moves above 1 and a bearish crossover is validated when -VM moves above 1\.

- en: Traders can reduce whipsaws by setting signal thresholds just above and below
    1\. A bullish signal can be divided into two parts. First, downward trend movement
    weakens. Second, upward trend movement strengthens. -VI often weakens and moves
    below .90 before an uptrend starts. After this weakening in downward trend movement,
    upward movement strengthens as +VI moves above 1.10 to complete the bullish signal.
    This bullish signal remains in play until countered with a bearish signal. The
    reverse logic can be applied to generate bearish signals. First, upward trend
    movement weakens with a move below .90\. Second, downward trend movement strengthens
    with a move above 1.10\.

    VTX. Despite numerous crosses of the two oscillators, there were only three “threshold”
    signals over a twelve-month period. First, -VM moved below .90 in early September
    and +VI crossed above 1.1 a few days later. Even though +VM moved below .90 several
    times, this bullish signal was not completely reversed because -VI never confirmed
    with a move above 1.10\. The second signal occurred when +VI moved below .90 in
    late February and -VI crossed above 1.1 in early March. The third signal occurred
    when -VI dipped below .90 in mid-June and +VI crossed above 1.1 a few days later.

    threshold crosses. The chart below shows Cummins (CMI) using daily bars and a
    14-period VTX. This indicator is much more sensitive (volatile) than the 23-period
    version. The yellow highlights mark the bullish signals and the orange highlights
    mark the bearish signals.

- en: Keep in mind that VTX is not designed as a standalone indicator. Chartists should
    use other aspects of technical analysis to confirm VTX, improve the reward-to-risk
    ratio for a trade setup, or derive buy-sell signals. The bullish VTX signal in
    early January was confirmed by a wedge breakout. After the bearish VTX signal
    in April, CMI formed a rising wedge and broke wedge support with a sharp decline
    in early May. VTX provided the alert and the price chart provided the signals.

- en: The Vortex Indicator is a unique directional indicator that provides clear signals
    and defines the overall trend. As with all technical analysis tools and indicators,
    the Vortex Indicator can be used on a range of securities and across various timeframes.
    For example, VTX can be applied to weekly and monthly charts to define the bigger
    trend and then applied to daily charts to generate signals within that trend.
    Using the daily chart, chartists could focus exclusively on bullish signals when
    VTX on the weekly chart indicates an uptrend. Conversely, chartists can focus
    on bearish signals when VTX on the daily chart is in bear mode.

    users can place the indicator above, below or behind the underlying price plot.
    Placing the indicator directly behind the price plot accentuates the movements
    relative to the price action of the underlying security. Users can apply “advanced
    options” to add horizontal lines and set signal thresholds. [Click here](http://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=$COMPQ&p=D&yr=0&mn=6&dy=0&id=p98321339986&a=277125891
