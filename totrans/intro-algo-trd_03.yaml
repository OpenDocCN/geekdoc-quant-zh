    trading is right for you.  Unfortunately, though, the way traders find out is

    I’ll discuss some of the important personality characteristics and traits I think
    are important (or not important) to be a successful algo trader.

    and right brain thinkers.  Left brain people tend to be more analytical, numbers
    oriented.  Typically, these people are found in positions like doctors, lawyers,
    accountants, scientists, engineers, computer programmers, etc.  Rules appeal to
    these sorts of people.
  prefs: []

    musicians, sales people, marketing folk and other “soft skill” careers tend to
    be their domain.

    brain traders may be more in tune with visual chart trading, and discretionary
    trading.  Most traders I have worked with for algo trading tend to be more left
    brain thinkers.  Over the years, I have done algo work with many doctors and scientists,
    but not so many artists.

    rules, and he had automation all set up.

    the week.  Had I just let it run, I would have made $2,500!”

    to enter or exit a trade at a moment’s notice when something does not feel right. 
    The idea of letting a computer alone control entries and exits is anathema to
    what these people are all about.  These traders want, and actually crave, the
    ultimate control over trades.

    parents who hover over their children, ready to swoop in at a moment’s notice

    control freaks e-mailing college professors and employers on behalf of their children! 
    Control freaks, to the max.

    testing, and setting up the trading strategy, but when the time comes, letting
    go and letting the backtest proven algorithm do its job.  It is not easy to do,
    especially at first.  But it is essential to proper algorithmic trading.

    a great backtest, is actually about the worst thing you can do.  You actually
    trick yourself, thinking that by continually testing, you make things better (notice
    a bit of control freakiness in that?).

    with a little effort you can turn each of your liabilities into an asset.  For
    example, if you do not have a set process for trading, go create one, and most
    importantly, follow it.  If you get easily frustrated, or you are an emotional
    powder keg, realizing that is the first step to changing it.  It will take some
    time, but before you even think about algo trading, spend some time working on
    yourself.  Once you can score 9 or 10 on the exercise, then you’ll be in good
    shape to start taking part in the many advantages of algorithmic trading.
