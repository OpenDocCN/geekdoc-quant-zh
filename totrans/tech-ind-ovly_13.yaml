- en: 'Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) is exactly what it sounds like: **the
    average price weighted by volume.** VWAP equals the dollar value of all trading
    periods divided by the total trading volume for the current day. The calculation
    starts when trading opens and ends when trading closes. Because it is good for
    the current trading day only, intraday periods and data are used in the calculation.'

- en: Traditional VWAP is based on tick data. As one can imagine, there are many ticks
    (trades) during each minute of the day. Active securities during active time periods
    can have 20-30 ticks in one minute alone. With 390 minutes in a typical stock
    exchange trading day, many stocks end up with well over 5000 ticks per day. There
    are over 5000 stocks traded every day and these ticks start adding up exponentially.
    Needless to say, tick-data is very resource intensive.

    on intraday periods (1, 5, 10, 15, 30 or 60 minute). Note that VWAP is not defined
    for daily, weekly or monthly periods due to the nature of the calculation (see
    below).

- en: 'There are five steps involved in the VWAP calculation. First, compute the typical
    price for the intraday period. This is the average of the high, low, and close:
    {(H+L+C)/3)}. Second, multiply the typical price by the period''s volume. Third,
    create a running total of these values. This is also known as a cumulative total.
    Fourth, create a running total of volume (cumulative volume). Fifth, divide the
    running total of price-volume by the running total of volume.'

    IBM. Dividing cumulative price-volume by cumulative volume produces a price level
    that is adjusted (weighted) by volume. The first VWAP value is always the typical
    price because volume is equal in the numerator and the denominator. They cancel
    each other out in the first calculation. The chart below shows 1-minute bars with
    VWAP for IBM. Prices ranged from 127.36 on the high to 126.67 on the low for the
    first 30 minutes of trading. It was actually a pretty volatile first 30 minutes.
    VWAP ranged from 127.21 to 127.09 and spent its time in the middle of this range.

- en: Like moving averages, VWAP lags price because it is an average based on past
    data. The more data there is, the greater the lag. A stock has been trading for
    some 331 minutes by 3:00 PM. As a cumulative “average”, this indicator is akin
    to a 330 period moving average. That is a lot of past data. The 1-minute VWAP
    value at the end of the day is often quite close to the ending value for a 390-minute
    moving average. Both moving averages are based on the 1-minute bars for that day.
    At the close, both are based on 390 minutes of data (one full day). One cannot
    compare the 390-minute moving average to VWAP during the day though. A 390-minute
    moving average at 12:00 PM will include data from the previous day. VWAP will
    not. Remember, VWAP calculations start fresh at the open and end at the close.
    150 minutes of trading have elapsed by 12:00 PM. Therefore, VWAP at 12:00 PM would
    need to be compared with a 150-minute moving average.

- en: Despite this lag, chartists can compare VWAP with the current price to determine
    the general direction of intraday prices. It works similar to a moving average.
    In general, intraday prices are falling when below VWAP and intraday prices are
    rising when above VWAP. VWAP will fall somewhere between the day's high-low range
    when prices are range bound for the day. The next three charts show examples of
    rising, falling and flat VWAP.

- en: VWAP is used to identify liquidity points. As a volume-weighted price measure,
    VWAP reflects price levels weighted by volume. This can help institutions with
    large orders. The idea is not to disrupt the market when entering large buy or
    sell orders. VWAP helps these institutions determine the [liquid](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:glossary_l#liquidity
    "chart_school:glossary_l") and illiquid price points for a specific security over
    a very short time period.

- en: VWAP can also be used to measure trading efficiency. After buying or selling
    a security, institutions or individuals can compare their price to VWAP values.
    A buy order executed below the VWAP value would be considered a good fill because
    the security was bought at a below average price. Conversely, a sell order executed
    above the VWAP would be deemed a good fill because it was sold at an above average
    price.

    suited for **intraday analysis.** Chartists can compare current prices with the
    VWAP values to determine the intraday trend. VWAP can also be used to determine
    relative value. Prices below VWAP values are relatively low for that day or that
    specific time. Prices above VWAP values are relatively high for that day or that
    specific time. **Keep in mind that VWAP is a cumulative indicator, which means
    the number of data points progressively increases throughout the day.** On a 1-minute
    chart, IBM will have 90 data points (minutes) by 11:00 AM, 210 data points by
    1:00 PM and 390 data points by the close. The number dramatically increases as
    the day extends. This is why VWAP lags price and this lag increases as the day
    extends.

- en: Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) can be plotted as an “overlay” indicator
    on Sharpcharts. After entering the security symbol, choose an “intraday” period
    and a “range.” This can be for 1 day or “fill the chart.” Chartists looking for
    more detail can choose “fill the chart.” Chartist looking for general levels can
    choose 1 day. VWAP can be plotted over more than one day, but the indicator will
    jump from its prior closing value to the typical price for the next open as a
    new calculation period begins. Also, note that VWAP values can sometimes fall
    off the price chart. VWAP at 45.5 will show up on a chart with a price range from
    45.8 to 47\. Chartists sometimes need to extend the range to a full day to see
    VWAP on the chart. The VWAP value is always displayed at the top left of the chart.
