- en: Developed by John Bollinger, Bollinger Bands® are volatility bands placed above
    and below a moving average. Volatility is based on the [standard deviation](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:standard_deviation_volatility
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:standard_deviation_volatility"), which changes
    as volatility increases and decreases. The bands automatically widen when volatility
    increases and narrow when volatility decreases. This dynamic nature of Bollinger
    Bands also means they can be used on different securities with the standard settings.
    For signals, Bollinger Bands can be used to identify M-Tops and W-Bottoms or to
    determine the strength of the trend. Signals derived from narrowing BandWidth
    are discussed in the [ChartSchool article on BandWidth.](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:bollinger_band_width
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:bollinger_band_width")

    band is a [simple moving average](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_averages
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_averages") that is usually set at 20
    periods. A simple moving average is used because the standard deviation formula
    also uses a simple moving average. The look-back period for the standard deviation
    is the same as for the simple moving average. The outer bands are usually set
    2 standard deviations above and below the middle band.'

- en: Settings can be adjusted to suit the characteristics of particular securities
    or trading styles. Bollinger recommends making small incremental adjustments to
    the standard deviation multiplier. Changing the number of periods for the moving
    average also affects the number of periods used to calculate the standard deviation.
    Therefore, only small adjustments are required for the standard deviation **multiplier**.
    An increase in the moving average period would automatically increase the number
    of periods used to calculate the standard deviation and would also warrant an
    increase in the standard deviation **multiplier**. With a 20-day SMA and 20-day
    Standard Deviation, the standard deviation multiplier is set at 2\. Bollinger
    suggests increasing the standard deviation multiplier to 2.1 for a 50-period SMA
    and decreasing the standard deviation multiplier to 1.9 for a 10-period SMA.

- en: W-Bottoms were part of Arthur Merrill's work that identified 16 patterns with
    a basic W shape. Bollinger uses these various W patterns with Bollinger Bands
    to identify W-Bottoms. A “W-Bottom” forms in a downtrend and involves two reaction
    lows. In particular, Bollinger looks for W-Bottoms where the second low is lower
    than the first but holds above the lower band. There are four steps to confirm
    a W-Bottom with Bollinger Bands. First, a reaction low forms. This low is usually,
    but not always, below the lower band. Second, there is a bounce towards the middle
    band. Third, there is a new price low in the security. This low holds **above**
    the lower band. The ability to hold above the lower band on the test shows less
    weakness on the last decline. Fourth, the pattern is confirmed with a strong move
    off the second low and a resistance break.

    the stock formed a reaction low in January (black arrow) and broke below the lower
    band. Second, there was a bounce back above the middle band. Third, the stock
    moved below its January low and held above the lower band. Even though the 5-Feb
    spike low broke the lower band, Bollinger Bands are calculated using closing prices
    so signals should also be based on closing prices. Fourth, the stock surged with
    expanding volume in late February and broke above the early February high. Chart

- en: M-Tops were also part of Arthur Merrill's work that identified 16 patterns with
    a basic M shape. Bollinger uses these various M patterns with Bollinger Bands
    to identify M-Tops. According to Bollinger, tops are usually more complicated
    and drawn out than bottoms. Double tops, head-and-shoulders patterns, and diamonds
    represent evolving tops.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In its most basic form, an M-Top is similar to a double top. However, the reaction
    highs are not always equal. The first high can be higher or lower than the second
    high. Bollinger suggests looking for signs of non-confirmation when a security
    is making new highs. This is basically the opposite of the W-Bottom. A non-confirmation
    occurs with three steps. First, a security creates a reaction high above the upper
    band. Second, there is a pullback towards the middle band. Third, prices move
    above the prior high but fail to reach the upper band. This is a warning sign.
    The inability of the second reaction high to reach the upper band shows waning
    momentum, which can foreshadow a trend reversal. Final confirmation comes with
    a support break or bearish indicator signal.

    moved above the upper band in April. There was a pullback in May and then another
    push above 90\. Even though the stock moved above the upper band on an intraday
    basis, it did not CLOSE above the upper band. The M-Top was confirmed with a support
    break two weeks later. Also, notice that MACD formed a bearish divergence and
    moved below its signal line for confirmation.

    exceeded the upper band in early September to affirm the uptrend. After a pullback
    below the 20-day SMA (middle Bollinger Band), the stock moved to a higher high
    above 17\. Despite this new high for the move, price did not exceed the upper
    band. This flashed a warning sign. The stock broke support a week later and MACD
    moved below its signal line. Notice that this M-top is more complex because there
    are lower reaction highs on either side of the peak (blue arrow). This evolving
    top formed a small head-and-shoulders pattern.

- en: Moves above or below the bands are not signals per se. As Bollinger puts it,
    moves that touch or exceed the bands are not signals, but rather “tags”. On the
    face of it, a move to the upper band shows strength, while a sharp move to the
    lower band shows weakness. Momentum oscillators work much the same way. Overbought
    is not necessarily bullish. It takes strength to reach overbought levels and overbought
    conditions can extend in a strong uptrend. Similarly, prices can “walk the band”
    with numerous touches during a strong uptrend. Think about it for a moment. The
    upper band is 2 standard deviations above the 20-period simple moving average.
    It takes a pretty strong price move to exceed this upper band. An upper band touch
    that occurs after a Bollinger Band confirmed W-Bottom would signal the start of
    an uptrend. Just as a strong uptrend produces numerous upper band tags, it is
    also common for prices to never reach the lower band during an uptrend. The 20-day
    SMA sometimes acts as support. In fact, dips below the 20-day SMA sometimes provide
    buying opportunities before the next tag of the upper band.

- en: Chart 6 shows Air Products (APD) with a surge and close above the upper band
    in mid-July. First, notice that this is a strong surge that broke above two resistance
    levels. A strong upward thrust is a sign of strength, not weakness. Trading turned
    flat in August and the 20-day SMA moved sideways. The Bollinger Bands narrowed,
    but APD did not close below the lower band. Prices and the 20-day SMA turned up
    in September. Overall, APD closed above the upper band at least five times over
    a four month period. The indicator window shows the 10-period Commodity Channel
    Index (CCI). Dips below -100 are deemed oversold and moves back above -100 signal
    the start of an oversold bounce (green dotted line). The upper band tag and breakout
    started the uptrend. CCI then identified tradable pullbacks with dips below -100\.
    This is an example of combining Bollinger Bands with a momentum oscillator for
    trading signals.

    down in January with a support break and closed below the lower band. From mid-January
    until early May, Monsanto closed below the lower band at least five times. Notice
    that the stock did not close above the upper band once during this period. The
    support break and initial close below the lower band signaled a downtrend. As
    such, the 10-period Commodity Channel Index (CCI) was used to identify short-term
    overbought situations. A move above +100 is overbought. A move back below +100
    signals a resumption of the downtrend (red arrows). This system triggered two
    good signals in early 2010\.

- en: Bollinger Bands reflect direction with the 20-period SMA and volatility with
    the upper/lower bands. As such, they can be used to determine if prices are relatively
    high or low. **According to Bollinger, the bands should contain 88-89% of price
    action, which makes a move outside the bands significant.** Technically, prices
    are relatively high when above the upper band and relatively low when below the
    lower band. However, relatively high should not be regarded as bearish or as a
    sell signal. Likewise, relatively low should not be considered bullish or as a
    buy signal. Prices are high or low for a reason. As with other indicators, Bollinger
    Bands are not meant to be used as a stand-alone tool. Chartists should combine
    Bollinger Bands with basic trend analysis and other indicators for confirmation.

    moving average, Bollinger Bands should be shown on top of a price plot. Upon selecting
    Bollinger Bands, the default setting will appear in the parameters window (20,2).
    The first number (20) sets the periods for the simple moving average and the standard
    deviation. The second number (2) sets the standard deviation multiplier for the
    upper and lower bands. These default parameters set the bands 2 standard deviations
    above/below the simple moving average. Users can change the parameters to suit
    their charting needs. Bollinger Bands (50,2.1) can be used for a longer timeframe
    or Bollinger Bands (10,1.9) can be used for a shorter timeframe. [Click here](http://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=QQQ&p=D&b=5&g=0&id=p50569930924
