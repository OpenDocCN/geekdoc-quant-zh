    "chart_school:glossary_o") situations. However, it is important to know when to
    look for overbought readings and when to look for oversold readings. As with most
    momentum oscillators, it is best to look for short-term oversold situations when
    the medium-term trend is up and short-term overbought situations when the medium-term
    trend is down. In other words, look for opportunities in the direction of the
    bigger trend, such as a pullback within a bigger uptrend. Define the bigger trend
    before looking for overbought or oversold readings.'

    1 several times, but did not even come close to 0\. Even though %B moved above
    1 numerous times, these “overbought” readings did not produce good sell signals.
    Pullbacks were shallow as Apple reversed well above the lower band and resumed
    its uptrend. John Bollinger refers to “walking the band” during strong trends.
    In a strong uptrend, prices can walk up the upper band and rarely touch the lower
    band. Conversely, prices can walk down the lower band and rarely touch the upper
    band in a strong downtrend.

- en: After identifying a bigger uptrend, %B can be considered oversold when it moves
    to zero or below. Remember, %B moves to zero when price hits the lower band and
    below zero when price moves below the lower band. This represents a move that
    is 2 standard deviations below the 20-day moving average. Chart 2 shows the Nasdaq
    100 ETF (QQQQ) within an uptrend that began in March 2009\. %B moved below zero
    three times during this uptrend. The oversold readings in early July and early
    November provided good entry points to partake in the bigger uptrend (green arrows).

- en: John Bollinger described a trend-following system using %B with the Money Flow
    Index (MFI). An uptrend begins when %B is above .80 and MFI(10) is above 80\.
    MFI is bound between zero and one hundred. A move above 80 places MFI(10) in the
    upper 20% of its range, which is a strong reading. Downtrends are identified when
    %B is below .20 and MFI(10) is below 20\.

- en: Chart 3 shows FedEx (FDX) with %B and MFI(10). An uptrend started in late July
    when %B was above .80 and MFI was above 80\. This uptrend was subsequently affirmed
    with two more signals in early September and mid-November. While these signals
    were good for trend identification, traders would likely have had issues with
    the risk-reward ratio after such big moves. It takes a substantial price surge
    to push %B above .80 and MFI(10) above 80 at the same time. Traders might consider
    using this method to identify the trend and then look for appropriate overbought
    or oversold levels for better entry points.

- en: '%B quantifies the relationship between price and Bollinger Bands. Readings
    above .80 indicate that price is near the upper band. Readings below .20 indicate
    that price is near the lower band. Surges towards the upper band show strength,
    but can sometimes be interpreted as overbought. Plunges to the lower band show
    weakness, but can sometimes be interpreted as oversold. A lot depends on the underlying
    trend and other indicators. While %B can have some value on its own, it is best
    when used in conjunction with other indicators or price analysis. [Click here](http://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=$SPX&p=D&yr=0&mn=6&dy=0&id=p62195116429&listNum=61&a=259167452
