    more about algo trading than probably 90% of people out there.  You have learned
    what it is, what it looks like and what kind of personalities are best suited
    for it.

- en: You have also been exposed to the advantages and disadvantages of this style
    of trading, and hopefully the downside has not scared you away.  Algo trading
    can be a fun and rewarding experience, but it is not easy.  But as I always say,
    sometimes the best things in life are the hardest things to do.  If algo trading
    was easy, everyone would do it, and there would be no longer be any financial
    incentive.

    not automatically a “supertrader” creator.  There is no easy way to trade, and
    algo trading is no exception.  Rest assured there are retail algo traders out
    there surviving against the hedge funds, commodity trading advisors, etc.

- en: Last year, I met a trader from Atlanta, Georgia in the US.  Based on our discussions,
    I knew he was a knowledgeable trader. Of course, I did not know for sure if he
    was a profitable trader (who ever knows for sure, unless you see verified trading
    records?), but it seemed like he was. In any event, I wanted to pick his brain
    a bit, as I do with many traders I talk to.

- en: I asked this trader “how do you historically backtest?”  His reply shocked me. 
    “I don’t believe in backtesting,” he explained, “since there are so many ways
    to cheat.  I find historical backtesting useless.  So, I do not do it, ever.” 
    I was flabbergasted.  How can someone trade a strategy without at least testing
    it first, to see if it even produces a profit?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Apparently, this trader saw no need for historical testing, and as crazy as
    I personally think it is, to each his own, I suppose.  I’ll assume, though, that
    you want to historically test your trading algorithms, which is the exact approach
    I use.  How do you do it?

- en: There are four major ways to test a strategy.  I’ll highlight the pros and cons
    of each method, before settling on what I think it the best long term solution
    for a new algo trader.  Any of the methods I discuss, though, could work well.

    While increased knowledge of computers usually makes them less intimidating, let’s
    assume that some people just do not want to test their trading algorithm with
    a computer.  How can they do it?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The answer brings me back to my early days of trading, where I wrote closing
    prices on a piece of paper, and calculated moving average with a simple handheld
    calculator.  So I know it can be done.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Manual testing involves the trader looking at each bar, making calculations
    by hand, and manually recording trades as the algorithm he or she is testing gives
    signals.  If that sounds like a slow and painful process, then I have described
    it well.  Manual testing is slow, cumbersome and very prone to errors.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Do you remember earlier when we saw the trendline trader with his “phantom”
    trades?  Someone manually testing might very well count that as a profitable trade. 
    “Close enough” is employed by many a manual tester, especially when profits are
    involved.  It is just human nature – to always look for the optimistic outcome
    for a trade.  The issue is that those optimistic backtest trades usually do not
    pan out in real time trading.

- en: Probably once a week, I get an e-mail from an aspiring trader.  Full of excitement,
    they want me to program and test their “Holy Grail” trading strategy.  Unfortunately,
    though, they lack the programming skills to do themselves, but they’d be willing
    to let me trade their creation for free if I just program and test it, again for
    free.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I always decline, since I know the probable outcome.  The strategy probably
    will not backtest well, and then endless tweaks (remember how bad they are?) and
    modifications are attempted in a desperate attempt to salvage the alleged Holy
    Grail.  When that fails, new strategies are proposed for programming, and the
    cycle repeats.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is why hiring a programmer or tester is usually bad.  Programmers are expensive,
    and if you are serious about algo trading, you will have dozens, if not hundreds,
    of strategies to program and test.  The bill for this effort will be substantial.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The benefit to going this route is that if your strategy is complicated, and
    your programming skills are weak, a good programmer can finish the job a lot more
    quickly and efficiently than you ever could.  And chances are, with an experienced
    tester, the results will be believable.

- en: Back in the early home computer days, I bought a laptop that I used for work
    during the day, and trading system evaluation at night.  Being on a shoestring
    budget, I could not afford the premier testing software from Omega Research (later
    renamed Tradestation).  So, since I had some programming knowledge in Fortran
    and Visual Basic, and advanced knowledge of spreadsheets (Microsoft Excel, Lotus
    1-2-3 and Borland Quattro Pro), I decided to create my own backtesting program.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As the months went by, I found that I had a pretty neat little backtest test
    package.  I kept adding on features to make testing go faster, to automate testing,
    to simulate real conditions, etc.  But as the software kept growing, I realized
    I did not have any finished algos I could trade!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That was a problem, obviously.  Somewhere along the line my goal became developing
    a great backtesting program, instead of developing some trading algorithms.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That is the trap you’ll run into if you try to develop your own backtester. 
    Sure, it will be customized to your requirements, but you’ll also spend a ton
    of time working on the software itself, rather than developing strategies.  That
    is true even for advanced programming languages like Python or R.  Many open source
    modules are available in these software languages, giving you a big head start,
    but you will still spend a lot of time integrating, testing and modifying the
    pieces.

    manual backtesting.  What a pain!  As soon as I had access to a personal computer
    at night, outside of my regular career working hours, I switched to option 3 –
    building my own backtesting platform.  I did that for a number of years, and had
    more success in programming the platform than I did in building the algorithms.

    understand and felt comfortable with strategy development.  And guess what?  The
    algo strategies I started to build became a lot better!
