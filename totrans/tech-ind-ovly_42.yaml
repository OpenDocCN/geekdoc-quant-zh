- en: 'The Pring Special K is a momentum indicator created by Martin Pring that combines
    short-term, intermediate and long-term velocity into one complete series, thereby
    giving us true summed cyclicality. It has two functions, first to identify primary
    trend reversals at a relatively early stage, and second to use that information
    for timing short-term pro-trend price moves. Here are all three trends as they
    might be expressed in an overlaid momentum format:'

- en: In an ideal world, the Special K ought to peak and trough more or less simultaneously
    with the price at bull and bear market turning points. In most situations that
    actually happens. When it does, the trick is being able to identify these turning
    points as quickly as possible after the fact. The formula assumes that prices
    are revolving around the four-year business cycle. As a result, when a linear
    uptrend, such as the 1990's secular bull market in equities develops, the Special
    K leads turning points. Alternatively, when the cycle is truncated, as was the
    case for the 1987 crash, the indicator is late. Charts 1 and 2 show that most
    of the time the price and SPK reverse simultaneously.

    points.*** Since this indicator also includes short-term data in its calculation
    a subsidiary benefit lies in the identification of smaller trends, for trading
    purposes, and putting that in context with the direction and maturity of the primary
    trend. Let''s consider both those aspects, starting with primary trend identification.'

    and relate them to primary trend peaks and troughs, as shown by the vertical arrows
    in the charts below. Unfortunately, since traders and investors work in real time,
    they do not have the luxury of hindsight. Here are several techniques that help
    in spotting primary trend turning points using the Special K:'

- en: Since the Special K is quite a jagged indicator it lends itself best to trendline
    construction. For example, if a trendline of 9-months or more is violated this
    usually means that the primary trend for the Special K has reversed and when the
    indicator changes trend so usually does the price.

- en: It is normal to run a moving average through the Special K. The default is a
    100-day smoothed by a 100-day SMA. Crossovers of the average typically signal
    a reversal in the direction of the primary trend. Occasionally, as with all moving
    average situations, whipsaws are triggered. When combined with a trendline break,
    though, a stronger and more reliable signal is triggered. Examples at the 2003
    and 2009 bottoms for US equities are shown in the first chart above, where MA
    crosses and trendline violations develop more or less simultaneously.

- en: Occasionally the Special K traces out price patterns. When they are confirmed
    by some kind of trend reversal in the price itself this usually represents a valid
    indication of a reversal in the prevailing primary trend. The GLD chart below
    offers two examples.

- en: It is important to note that calculating the initial plot of the Special K involves
    several years of data. To really appreciate the long-term perspective offered
    by this indicator 5-10 years of additional data are required. That way it's possible
    to see if the security in question is experiencing the expected cyclical swings.
    Most do, but occasionally you will find some that do not.

- en: One of the most important things for short-term traders to grasp is the fact
    that trades executed in the direction of the main trend are much more likely to
    be successful than those generated in a counter-cyclical way. An objective method
    of determining the direction of the primary trend is to use the Special K. Obviously
    we can easily tell with the benefit of hindsight where the actual Special K peaks
    and troughs formed but in real time we do not have this luxury. One solution is
    to determine its position relative to its 100-day MA. Positive readings (i.e.
    above the MA) would indicate a primary bull market and vice versa.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When the direction of the primary trend has been determined to be bullish, trades
    from the long side would be initiated when the Special K itself crosses above
    its 10-day MA. These are shown with orange, upward arrows on the chart below.
    Trades would be closed out when the Special K re-crosses back below its 10-day
    MA. Short sales would be initiated in the opposite way i.e. when the Special K
    is below its long-term MA and crosses below its 10-day MA. The chart below shows
    such a system for the Dow Jones UBS Commodity Index. The green vertical line represents
    the start of a bull market phase as defined by the Special K/100-day MA relationship.

- en: Note that no buy signals are generated during the bearish periods, only sell
    signals (brown, downward arrows). The “Example Sell Point” was subpar because
    it developed during a bull market, but unfortunately, the system was still in
    a bearish mode because the Special K was below its 100-day MA showing that this
    approach is far from perfect. As with all technical indicators, rather than blindly
    using this approach as a mechanical system, it's better to use pro trend signals
    as an alert and then use other indicators as a filter in a “weight of the evidence”
    approach.
