- en: TRIX is a momentum oscillator that displays the percent [rate of change](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:rate_of_change_roc_and_momentum
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:rate_of_change_roc_and_momentum") of a triple
    exponentially smoothed moving average. It was developed in the early 1980's by
    Jack Hutson, an editor for *Technical Analysis of Stocks and Commodities* magazine.
    With its triple smoothing, TRIX is designed to filter insignificant price movements.
    Chartists can use TRIX to generate signals similar to MACD. A signal line can
    be applied to look for signal line crossovers. A directional bias can be determined
    with the absolute level. Bullish and bearish divergences can be used to anticipate
    reversals.

    EMA and triple-smoothed EMA. Notice how each EMA lags price a little more. Even
    though exponential moving averages put more weight on recent data, they still
    contain past data that produces a lag. This lag increases with each smoothing.

    of the four lines. The red line is the 15-day EMA, which follows the price plot
    the closest. The green line is the double-smoothed EMA and the purple line is
    the triple-smoothed EMA. Notice how these two lines turn flatter as the lag increases.

    TRIX turns positive when the triple-smoothed 15-day EMA turns up. The extra smoothing
    ensures that upturns and downturns are kept to a minimum. In other words, it takes
    more than a one-day advance to reverse a downtrend.

- en: TRIX (15,9) is quite similar to [MACD (12,26,9)](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_average_convergence_divergence_macd
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_average_convergence_divergence_macd").
    Both are momentum oscillators that fluctuate above and below the zero line. Both
    have signal lines based on a 9-day EMA. Most notably, both lines have similar
    shapes, signal line crossovers, and centerline crosses. The biggest difference
    between TRIX and MACD is that TRIX is smoother than MACD. The TRIX lines are less
    jagged and tend to turn a bit later.

- en: With the similarities outweighing the differences, signals applicable to MACD
    are also applicable to TRIX. There are three main signals to watch for. First,
    signal line crossovers are the most common signals. These indicate a change in
    direction for TRIX and price momentum. A cross above the signal line is the first
    bullish indication, while a cross below is the first negative implication. Second,
    centerline crossovers provide chartists with a general momentum bias. The triple-smoothed
    moving average is rising when TRIX is positive and falling when negative. Similarly,
    momentum favors the bulls when TRIX is positive and the bears when negative. Third,
    bullish and bearish divergences can alert chartists of a possible trend reversal.

- en: Signal line crossovers are the most common TRIX signals. The signal line is
    a 9-day EMA of the TRIX. As a moving average of the indicator, it trails TRIX
    and makes it easier to spot turns. A bullish crossover occurs when TRIX turns
    up and crosses above the signal line. A bearish crossover occurs when TRIX turns
    down and crosses below the signal line. Crossovers can last a few days or a few
    weeks, it all depends on the strength of the move. Due diligence is required before
    relying on these frequent signals. Volatility in the underlying security can also
    increase the number of crossovers.

    a seven-month period. That is almost one per month. There were three good signals
    and three bad signals resulting in whipsaws (yellow area). The bullish crossover
    in June occurred near the top, the bearish crossover in late June occurred near
    the low and the bullish crossover in July occurred near the top. In the absence
    of a strong move, the lag from the triple-smoothed EMA results in late signals
    that produce losses. The bearish signal line cross in August foreshadowed a sharp
    decline and the bullish signal line cross in mid-September foreshadowed a strong
    advance.

    indicates when the cup is half full (bullish) or half empty (bearish). Think of
    the centerline as the 50-yard line in a football game. The offense has the edge
    after crossing the 50 (midpoint), while the defense has the edge as long as the
    ball remains beyond the 50\. As with signal line crossovers, these centerline
    crossovers produce both good signals and bad signals. The key, as always, is to
    minimize losses on the bad signals and maximize gains with the good signals.

- en: The chart above shows Raytheon (RTN) with five signals over a 16 month period.
    The first three were bad because the stock changed direction soon after the signals.
    In other words, a trend failed to take hold. The fourth signal (November 2009)
    coincided with a resistance breakout and foreshadowed a 20% advance. Great signal!
    This is also a classic example of combining indicator signals with chart signals
    for reinforcement. The resistance breakout on the price chart and the centerline
    cross for the TRIX reinforced each other. TRIX produced a nice bearish signal
    in May 2010 as RTN subsequently declined around 20%.

- en: Bullish and bearish divergences form when the security and the indicator do
    not confirm one another. A bullish divergence forms when the security forges a
    lower low, but the indicator forms a higher low. This higher low shows less downside
    momentum that may foreshadow a bullish reversal. A bearish divergence forms when
    the security forges a higher low, but the indicator forms a lower high. This lower
    high shows waning upside momentum that can sometimes foreshadow a bearish reversal.
    Before looking at a successful divergence, note the BHP Billiton (BHP) chart with
    several unsuccessful divergences.

- en: Bearish divergences do not work well in strong uptrends. Even though momentum
    seems to be waning because the indicator is producing lower highs, momentum still
    has a bullish bias as long as the indicator is above its centerline. Upward momentum
    may be less positive, but it is still positive as long as the cup is half full.
    The rise is just not as fast as before. The opposite is true for bullish divergences.
    These do not work well in strong downtrends. Even though the indicator shows less
    downside momentum with higher lows, downward momentum is still stronger than upward
    momentum as long as the indicator remains below its centerline.

    separating the bad signals from the good signals. The chart below shows eBay (EBAY)
    with a successful bullish divergence. The stock moved to a lower low in early
    July, but TRIX held well above its prior low and formed a bullish divergence.
    The first potential confirmation came when TRIX moved above its signal line. However,
    there were no confirmations on the chart at the time. These came a little later.
    The green arrows show EBAY breaking chart resistance with good volume and TRIX
    moving into positive territory. Even though confirmation occurred well off the
    low, there were enough signs of strength to validate the breakout.

- en: TRIX is an indicator that combines trend with momentum. The triple smoothed
    moving average covers the trend, while the 1-period percentage change measures
    momentum. In this regard, TRIX is similar to MACD and PPO. The standard setting
    for TRIX is 15 for the triple smoothed EMA and 9 for the signal line. Chartists
    looking for more sensitivity should try a shorter timeframe (5 versus 15). This
    will make the indicator more volatile and better suited for centerline crossovers.
    Chartists looking for less sensitivity should try a longer timeframe (45 versus
    15). This will smooth the indicator and make it better suited for signal line
    crossovers. As with all indicators, TRIX should be used in conjunction with other
    aspects of technical analysis, such as [chart patterns](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:chart_analysis:chart_patterns
    "chart_school:chart_analysis:chart_patterns").

    It is easy to compare indicator/price movements when the indicator is placed behind
    the price plot. Once the indicator is chosen from the dropdown list, the default
    parameter setting appears (15,9). These parameters can be adjusted to increase
    or decrease sensitivity. The signal line default is 9, which can also be adjusted.
