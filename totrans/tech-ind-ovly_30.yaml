- en: Developed by Richard Arms, Ease of Movement (EMV) is a volume-based oscillator
    that fluctuates above and below the zero line. As its name implies, it is designed
    to measure the “ease” of price movement. Arms created [Equivolume](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:chart_analysis:equivolume
    "chart_school:chart_analysis:equivolume") charts to visually display price ranges
    and volume. Ease of Movement takes Equivolume to the next level by quantifying
    the price/volume relationship and showing the results as an oscillator. In general,
    prices are advancing with relative ease when the oscillator is in positive territory.
    Conversely, prices are declining with relative ease when the oscillator is in
    negative territory.

- en: 'There are three parts to the EMV formula: distance moved, volume and the high-low
    range. First, the distance moved is calculated by comparing the current period''s
    midpoint with the prior period''s midpoint, which is the high plus the low divided
    by two. Distance moved is positive when the current midpoint is above the prior
    midpoint and negative when the current midpoint is below the prior midpoint. Distance
    moved is shown as the numerator in the formula below.'

- en: The other two parts form the Box ratio, which uses volume and the high-low range.
    Equivolume charts are based on volume and the high-low range as well. The Box
    ratio is the denominator of EMV. Note that volume is divided by 100,000,000 to
    keep it relevant with the other numbers.
  prefs: []

- en: Relatively low volume and a relatively large high-low range will produce a smaller
    denominator (Box ratio), which means the EMV value will be larger because of division
    by a smaller number. The Box ratio would be .50 if V/10000000 equals 2 and the
    high-low range equals 4\. A wide range on low volume implies relatively easy price
    movement. In other words, it did not take much volume to move prices.

- en: A relatively small high-low range on high volume would produce a larger denominator,
    which means the EMV value will be smaller. The denominator would be 2 if V/10000000
    equals 4 and the high-low range equals 2\. This implies that price movement was
    difficult because there was a relatively small high-low range on big volume.

- en: The example below shows the Nasdaq 100 ETF (QQQ) with the 1-period EMV in the
    lower indicator window. I am using Equivolume bars because these show only the
    high-low range for the given period. The blue arrows show two small EMV values.
    One is slightly positive and the other is slightly negative. Volume on both days
    was above average, but the high-low range was modest or even small. This means
    prices had difficulty moving even though volume was relatively high.

- en: The red arrow shows an EMV value near -3, which is very negative. This is because
    volume was low and the high-low range was large. This implies that prices declined
    with relative ease and there was little buying or no buying pressure. The green
    arrow shows an EMV value near +3\. Again, volume was low and the high-low range
    was large. This means prices advanced with relative ease and there was little
    or no selling pressure. The chart below shows Jabil Circuit (JBL) with the 14-period
    Ease of Movement indicator. This is just a 14-period simple [moving average](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_averages
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_averages") of each period's EMV value.

- en: Ease of Movement is best used to confirm other indicators or chart analysis.
    In other words, it is not a standalone indicator. Keep in mind that the “Distance
    Moved” portion of the formula is the positive/negative driver. EMV is generally
    positive when the midpoint rises and negative when the midpoint falls. This means
    EMV will generally rise and fall along with the price of the underlying security.
    The amount of this rise or fall depends on the Box ratio. Chartists can use EMV
    to confirm a breakout on the price chart or a bullish indicator signal. Conversely,
    a move into negative territory can be used to confirm a breakdown on the price
    chart or a bearish indicator signal.

    and a bullish breakout in mid-June. Prior to the bearish breakdown, EMV deteriorated
    for two months and dipped into negative territory in March. With the stock rising
    and EMV declining in January-February, the advance was becoming more laborious
    (difficult). MOS broke support with a decline in early April and EMV confirmed
    with another dip into negative territory. After negative readings for most of
    April and May, EMV improved from late May to early June with a move into positive
    territory. The stock also formed a small inverse head-and-shoulders and broke
    resistance at 50\.

    and the price chart. After advancing from January to mid-March, VLO reversed course
    and broke support at the end of March. Notice that EMV broke its late February
    low and moved deep into negative territory at the end of March. Also, notice that
    RSI broke to its lowest level since early January. The second reversal occurred
    when VLO broke resistance in mid-July. EMV began to improve before this breakout
    and was firmly positive at the time of the breakout. [RSI](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:relative_strength_index_rsi
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:relative_strength_index_rsi") also confirmed
    with a break above its April high and a move above 55\.

- en: Ease of Movement (EMV) combines price direction with volume to create a volume-based
    momentum oscillator. Because it is closely tied with price changes, EMV tends
    to track the price of the underlying security quite closely. For the most part,
    EMV is used to confirm signals derived from the price chart or other indicators.
    Chartists looking for a smoother EMV line can lengthen the look-back period.

- en: Ease of Movement (EMV) can be found in the “indicators” section under the chart.
    Users can adjust the settings by changing the numbers in the “parameters” box.
    The indicator can then be positioned “behind price”, “above” the main window or
    “below” the main window. It helps to change the color when placing it behind the
    price. Chartists can also add a moving average using the “advanced” indicator
    options.
