- en: Developed by Larry Williams, Williams %R is a momentum indicator that is the
    inverse of the Fast [Stochastic Oscillator](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:stochastic_oscillator_fast_slow_and_full
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:stochastic_oscillator_fast_slow_and_full").
    Also referred to as %R, Williams %R reflects the level of the close relative to
    the highest high for the look-back period. In contrast, the Stochastic Oscillator
    reflects the level of the close relative to the lowest low. %R corrects for the
    inversion by multiplying the raw value by -100\. As a result, the Fast Stochastic
    Oscillator and Williams %R produce the exact same lines, only the scaling is different.
    Williams %R oscillates from 0 to -100\. Readings from 0 to -20 are considered
    overbought. Readings from -80 to -100 are considered oversold. Unsurprisingly,
    signals derived from the Stochastic Oscillator are also applicable to Williams
    %R.

    months or an intraday timeframe. A 14-period %R would use the most recent close,
    the highest high over the last 14 periods and the lowest low over the last 14
    periods.

- en: As with the Stochastic Oscillator, Williams %R reflects the level of the close
    relative to the high-low range over a given period of time. Assume that the highest
    high equals 110, the lowest low equals 100 and the close equals 108\. The high-low
    range is 10 (110 - 100), which is the denominator in the %R formula. The highest
    high less the close equals 2 (110 - 108), which is the numerator 0.2 divided by
    10 equals 0.20\. Multiply this number by -100 to get -20 for %R. If the close
    was 103, Williams %R would be -70 (((110-103)/10) x -100).

    0 and -100, which makes -50 the midpoint. Think of it as the 50 yard line in football.
    The offense has a higher chance of scoring when it crosses the 50 yard line. The
    defense has an edge as long as it prevents the offense from crossing the 50 yard
    line. A Williams %R cross above -50 signals that prices are trading in the upper
    half of their high-low range for the given look-back period. This suggests that
    the cup is half full. Conversely, a cross below -50 means prices are trading in
    the bottom half of the given look-back period. This suggests that the cup is half
    empty.

    period. High readings (above -20) indicate that price is near its high for the
    given time period. The IBM example above shows three 14-day ranges (yellow areas)
    with the closing price at the end of the period (red dotted) line. Williams %R
    equals -9 when the close was at the top of the range. The Williams %R equals -87
    when the close was near the bottom of the range. The close equals -43 when the
    close was in the middle of the range.

    "chart_school:technical_indicators:introduction_to_technical_indicators_and_oscillators"),
    Williams %R makes it easy to identify overbought and oversold levels. The oscillator
    ranges from 0 to -100\. No matter how fast a security advances or declines, Williams
    %R will always fluctuate within this range. Traditional settings use -20 as the
    overbought threshold and -80 as the oversold threshold. These levels can be adjusted
    to suit analytical needs and security characteristics. Readings above -20 for
    the 14-day Williams %R would indicate that the underlying security was trading
    near the top of its 14-day high-low range. Readings below -80 occur when a security
    is trading at the low end of its high-low range.

- en: Before looking at some chart examples, it is important to note that overbought
    readings are not necessarily bearish. Securities can become overbought and remain
    overbought during a strong uptrend. Closing levels that are consistently near
    the top of the range indicate sustained buying pressure. In a similar vein, oversold
    readings are not necessarily bullish. Securities can also become oversold and
    remain oversold during a strong downtrend. Closing levels consistently near the
    bottom of the range indicate sustained selling pressure.

- en: Chart 3 shows Arch Coal (ACI) with 14-day Williams %R hitting overbought and
    oversold levels on a regular basis. The red dotted lines mark a move below -50
    that occurs after an overbought reading. The green dotted lines mark a move above
    -50 that occurs after an oversold reading. As noted above, overbought is not necessarily
    bearish and oversold is not necessarily bullish. Top and bottom pickers can act
    when overbought or oversold, but it is often prudent to wait for a confirmation
    move. A move below -50 confirms a downturn after an overbought reading. A move
    above -50 confirms an upturn after an oversold reading.

- en: The failure to move back into overbought or oversold territory signals a change
    in momentum that can foreshadow a significant price move. The ability to consistently
    move above -20 is a show of strength. After all, it takes buying pressure to push
    %R into overbought territory. Once a security shows strength by pushing into overbought
    territory more than once, a subsequent failure to exceed this level shows weakening
    momentum that can foreshadow a decline.

    overbought readings from February to April. Even after the plunge below -80 in
    early April, %R surged back above -20 to show continuing strength. After a few
    more weeks of overbought readings, %R plunged to oversold levels in early May.
    This deep plunge showed strong selling pressure. The subsequent recovery fell
    short of -20 and did not reach overbought territory. This provided the second
    sign of weakness. After failing below -20, the decline below -50 signaled a downturn
    in momentum and the stock declined rather sharply. Another failure just below
    -20 in mid-June also resulted in a sharp decline.

    can adjust the look-back period to suit their analysis objectives. A longer timeframe
    makes the indicator less sensitive. After becoming overbought in October, the
    indicator moved lower and became oversold twice in December. The January surge
    carried %R into overbought territory and the stock broke channel resistance. These
    were promising signs. On the subsequent pullback, %R held above -80 and did not
    become oversold. This showed underlying strength. The subsequent move above -50
    foreshadowed a sharp advance over the next few months.

- en: Williams %R is a momentum oscillator that measures the level of the close relative
    to the high-low range over a given period of time. In addition to the signals
    mentioned above, chartists can use %R to gauge the six-month trend for a security.
    125-day %R covers around 6 months. Prices are above their 6-month average when
    %R is above -50, which is consistent with an uptrend. Readings below -50 are consistent
    with a downtrend. In this regard, %R can be used to help define the bigger trend
    (six months). Like all technical indicators, it is important to use the Williams
    %R in conjunction with other technical analysis tools. Volume, [chart patterns](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:chart_analysis:chart_patterns
    "chart_school:chart_analysis:chart_patterns") and breakouts can be used to confirm
    or refute signals produced by Williams %R.
