    explain how to use them in your analysis. We will shed light on the difference
    between **leading** and **lagging indicators**, as well as look into the benefits
    and drawbacks. Many, if not most, popular indicators are shown as **oscillators**.
    With this in mind, we will also show how to read oscillators and explain how signals
    are derived. Later we will turn our focus to specific technical indicators and
    provide examples of signals in action.

    a formula to the price data of a security.** Price data includes any combination
    of the open, high, low or close over a period of time. Some indicators may use
    only the closing prices, while others incorporate [volume](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:glossary_v#volume
    "chart_school:glossary_v") and open interest into their formulas. The price data
    is entered into the formula and a data point is produced.'

    / 3 = 42.33 ]. However, one data point does not offer much information and does
    not an indicator make. A series of data points over a period of time is required
    to create valid reference points to enable analysis. By creating a time series
    of data points, a comparison can be made between present and past levels. For
    analysis purposes, technical indicators are usually shown in a graphical form
    above or below a security's price chart. Once shown in graphical form, an indicator
    can then be compared with the corresponding price chart of the security. Sometimes
    indicators are plotted on top of the price plot for a more direct comparison.

    are relatively easy to understand. Others, such as [Stochastics](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:glossary_s#stochastic_oscillator

    indicators can provide a unique perspective on the strength and direction of the

    Veritas (VRTSE) displays a lot of volatility and an analyst may have difficulty
    discerning a trend. By applying a 10-day simple moving average to the price action,
    random fluctuations are smoothed to make it easier to identify a trend.'

    the price action of a security and focus solely on an indicator. Indicators filter
    price action with formulas. As such, they are derivatives and not direct reflections
    of the price action. This should be taken into consideration when applying analysis.

    speaking, momentum measures the rate-of-change of a security's price.** As the
    price of a security rises, price momentum increases. The faster the security rises
    (the greater the period-over-period price change), the larger the increase in
    momentum. Once this rise begins to slow, momentum will also slow. As a security
    begins to trade flat, momentum starts to actually decline from previous high levels.
    However, declining momentum in the face of sideways trading is not always a bearish
    signal. It simply means that momentum is returning to a more median level.

    (*a momentum indicator*) compares the average price change of the advancing periods
    with the average change of the declining periods.** On the IBM chart, RSI advanced
    from October to the end of November. During this period, the stock advanced from
    the upper 60s to the low 80s. When the stock traded sideways in the first half
    of December, RSI dropped rather sharply (blue lines). This consolidation in the
    stock was quite normal and actually healthy. From these lofty levels (near 70),
    flat price action would be expected to cause a decline in RSI (and momentum).
    If RSI were trading around 50 and the stock began to trade flat, the indicator
    would not be expected to decline. The green lines on the chart mark a period of
    sideways trading in the stock and in RSI. RSI started from a relatively median
    level, around 50\. The subsequent flat price action in the stock also produced
    relatively flat price action in the indicator and it remains around 50\.

- en: There are clearly many benefits to using leading indicators. **Early signaling
    for entry and exit is the main benefit**. Leading indicators generate more signals
    and allow more opportunities to trade. Early signals can also act to forewarn
    against a potential strength or weakness. Because they generate more signals,
    leading indicators are best used in trading markets. These indicators can be used
    in trending markets, but usually *with* the major trend, *not against* it. In
    a market that is trending up, the best use is to help identify oversold conditions
    for buying opportunities. In a market that is trending down, leading indicators
    can help identify overbought situations for selling opportunities.

    commonly referred to as trend-following indicators. Rarely, if ever, will these
    indicators lead the price of a security. Trend-following indicators work best
    when markets or securities develop strong trends. They are designed to get traders
    in and keep them in as long as the trend is intact. As such, these indicators
    are not effective in trading or sideways markets. If used in trading markets,
    trend-following indicators will likely lead to many false signals and whipsaws.
    Some popular trend-following indicators include [moving averages](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:glossary_m#moving_average_ma

    a move and remain in a move. Provided the market or security in question develops

    a trading range. In the S&P 500 example, the index appears to have been range-bound
    at least 50% of the time. Even though the index trended higher from 1982 to 1999,
    there have also been large periods of sideways movement. From 1964 to 1980, the
    index traded within a large range bound by 85 and 110\.

    the Oct-98 low of 950\. **Late entry and exit points can skew the risk/reward

    In an ideal world, we want an indicator that is sensitive to price movements,
    gives early signals and has few false signals (whipsaws). If we increase the sensitivity
    by reducing the number of periods, an indicator will provide early signals, but
    the number of false signals will increase. If we decrease sensitivity by increasing
    the number of periods, then the number of false signals will decrease, but the
    signals will lag and this will skew the [reward-to-risk ratio](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:glossary_r#reward-to-risk_ratio

    be generated. As the moving average is shortened, it becomes faster and more volatile,
    increasing the number of false signals. The same holds true for the various momentum
    indicators. A 14 period RSI will generate fewer signals than a 5 period RSI. The
    5 period RSI will be much more sensitive and have more overbought and oversold
    readings. It is up to each investor to select a timeframe that suits his or her
    trading style and objectives.

    MACD incorporates aspects of momentum or leading elements. The difference between
    the moving averages represents the rate of change. By measuring the rate-of-change,
    MACD becomes a leading indicator, but still with a bit of lag. With the integration

    bullish momentum and readings below the center point indicate bearish momentum.
    The biggest difference between centered oscillators and banded oscillators is
    the latter's ability to identify extreme readings. While it is possible to identify
    extreme readings with centered oscillators, they are not ideal for this purpose.

    In a strong uptrend, an oscillator can reach an overbought condition and remain
    so as the underlying security continues to advance. A negative divergence may
    form, but a bearish signal against the uptrend should be considered suspect. In
    a strong downtrend, an oscillator can reach an oversold condition and remain so
    as the underlying security continues to decline. Similarly, a positive divergence
    may form, but a bullish signal against the downtrend should be considered suspect.

    an extremity. We know that when RSI is below 30 or the Stochastic Oscillator is
    below 20, an oversold condition exists. By that same token, when RSI is above
    70 and the Stochastic Oscillator is above 80, an overbought condition exists.

    is generated. If a security is oversold (below 30 for RSI and 20 for the Stochastic

    and combine that with a moving average crossover and a break below 80 to generate
    a signal. (Note: The Stochastic Oscillator is usually plotted with a 3-day simple
