- en: Developed by Perry Kaufman, Kaufman's Adaptive Moving Average (KAMA) is a moving
    average designed to account for market noise or volatility. KAMA will closely
    follow prices when the price swings are relatively small and the noise is low.
    KAMA will adjust when the price swings widen and follow prices from a greater
    distance. This trend-following indicator can be used to identify the overall trend,
    time turning points and filter price movements.

- en: Before calculating KAMA, we need to calculate the Efficiency Ratio (ER) and
    the Smoothing Constant (SC). Breaking down the formula into bite-size nuggets
    makes it easier to understand the methodology behind the indicator. Note that
    ABS stands for Absolute Value.

- en: In statistical terms, the Efficiency Ratio tells us the fractal efficiency of
    price changes. ER fluctuates between 1 and 0, but these extremes are the exception,
    not the norm. ER would be 1 if prices moved up 10 consecutive periods or down
    10 consecutive periods. ER would be zero if price is unchanged over the 10 periods.

- en: As you may have noticed, the Smoothing Constant is using the smoothing constants
    for an exponential moving average in its formula. (2/30+1) is the smoothing constant
    for a 30-period EMA. The Fastest SC is the smoothing constant for shorter EMA
    (2-periods). The slowest SC is the smoothing constant for the slowest EMA (30-periods).
    Note that the “2” at the end is to square the equation.

    to calculate Kaufman's Adaptive Moving Average (KAMA). Since we need an initial
    value to start the calculation, the first KAMA is just a simple moving average.
    The following calculations are based on the formula below.

- en: Chartists can use KAMA like any other trend following indicator, such as a moving
    average. Chartists can look for price crosses, directional changes, and filtered
    signals.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, a cross above or below KAMA indicates directional changes in prices.
    As with any moving average, a simple crossover system will generate lots of signals
    and lots of whipsaws. Chartists can reduce whipsaws by applying a price or time
    filter to the crossovers. One might require price to hold the cross for a set
    number of days or require the cross to exceed KAMA by a set percentage.

- en: Second, chartists can use the direction of KAMA to define the overall trend
    for a security. This may require a parameter adjustment to smooth the indicator
    further. Chartists can change the middle parameter, which is the fastest EMA constant,
    to smooth KAMA and look for directional changes. The trend is down as long as
    KAMA is falling and forging lower lows. The trend is up as long as KAMA is rising
    and forging higher highs. The Kroger example below shows KAMA(10,5,30) with a
    steep uptrend from December to March and a less-steep uptrend from May to August.

- en: And finally, chartists can combine signals and techniques. Chartists can use
    a longer-term KAMA to define the bigger trend and a shorter-term KAMA for trading
    signals. For example, KAMA (10,5,30) could be used as a trend filter and be deemed
    bullish when rising. Once bullish, chartists could then look for bullish crosses
    when price moves above KAMA (10,2,30). The example below shows MMM with a rising
    long-term KAMA and bullish crosses in December, January, and February. Long-term
    KAMA turned down in April and there were bearish crosses in May, June, and July.

- en: KAMA can be found as an indicator overlay in the SharpCharts workbench. The
    default settings will automatically appear in the parameter box once it is selected
    and chartists can change these parameters to suit their analytical needs. The
    first parameter is for the Efficiency Ratio and chartists should refrain from
    increasing this number. Instead, chartists can decrease it to increase sensitivity.
    Chartists looking to smooth KAMA for longer-term trend analysis can increase the
    middle parameter incrementally. Even though the difference is just 3, KAMA(10,5,30)
    is significantly smoother than KAMA(10,2,30).
