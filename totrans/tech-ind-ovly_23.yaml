- en: Developed by Marc Chaikin, the Chaikin Oscillator measures the momentum of the
    Accumulation Distribution Line using the [MACD formula](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_average_convergence_divergence_macd
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_average_convergence_divergence_macd").
    This makes it an indicator of an indicator. The Chaikin Oscillator is the difference
    between the 3-day EMA of the Accumulation Distribution Line and the 10-day EMA
    of the Accumulation Distribution Line. Like other momentum indicators, this indicator
    is designed to anticipate directional changes in the Accumulation Distribution
    Line by measuring the momentum behind the movements. A momentum change is the
    first step to a trend change. Anticipating trend changes in the Accumulation Distribution
    Line can help chartists anticipate trend changes in the underlying security. The
    Chaikin Oscillator generates signals with crosses above/below the zero line or
    with bullish/bearish divergences.

    Chaikin Oscillator. This article will cover the basic elements of the Accumulation
    Distribution Line. See our [ChartSchool article](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:accumulation_distribution_line
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:accumulation_distribution_line") the details.
    There are three steps to calculating the Accumulation Distribution Line (ADL).
    First, calculate the Money Flow Multiplier. Second, multiply this value by volume
    to find Money Flow Volume. Third, create a running total of Money Flow Volume
    to form the Accumulation Distribution Line (ADL). Fourth, take the difference
    between two moving averages to calculate the Chaikin Oscillator.

- en: The Accumulation Distribution Line rises when the Money Flow Multiplier is positive
    and falls when negative. This multiplier is positive when the close is in the
    upper a half of the period's high-low range and negative when the close is in
    the lower half. As a MACD type oscillator, the Chaikin Oscillator turns positive
    when the faster 3-day EMA moves above the slower 10-day EMA. Conversely, the indicator
    turns negative when the 3-day EMA moves below the 10-day EMA.

    EMA in (blue) and the 10-day EMA (red). The price for General Electric (GE) is
    invisible so we can focus on the relationship between the Accumulation Distribution
    Line and the Chaikin Oscillator. Notice how the Chaikin Oscillator moves into
    negative territory as the 3-day EMA moves below the 10-day EMA. Conversely, the
    oscillator turns positive when the 3-day EMA crosses above the 10-day EMA.

- en: First and foremost, it is important to remember that the Chaikin Oscillator
    is an indicator of an indicator. It measures momentum for the Accumulation Distribution
    Line. This makes it at least three steps removed from the price of the underlying
    security. First, price and volume are reshaped into the Accumulation Distribution
    Line. Second, exponential moving averages are applied to the Accumulation Distribution
    Line. Third, the difference between the [moving averages](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_averages
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_averages") is used to form the Chaikin
    Oscillator. As the third derivative, the indicator is more prone to disconnect
    from the price of the underlying security.

    buying and selling pressure (Accumulation Distribution Line). A move into positive
    territory indicates that the Accumulation Distribution Line is rising and buying
    pressure prevails. A move into negative territory indicates that the Accumulation
    Distribution Line is falling and selling pressure prevails. Chartists can anticipate
    crosses into positive or negative territory by looking for bullish or bearish
    divergences, respectively.

- en: The Chaikin oscillator can be used to define a general buying or selling bias
    simply with positive or negative values. The indicator oscillates above/below
    the zero line. Generally, buying pressure is stronger when the indicator is positive
    and selling pressure is stronger when the indicator is negative.

- en: The default settings for the Chaikin Oscillator (3,10) often produce a line
    that frequently crosses zero. Chartists can smooth the indicator by lengthening
    the moving averages. The example below shows the Chaikin Oscillator (6,20). Both
    moving averages were doubled to maintain the ratio and smooth the indicator.

    12 months. There were some good signals, such as the April sell signal and the
    October buy signal. There were also some bad signals or whipsaws. The key, as
    with all indicators, is to confirm the oscillator signals with other aspects of
    technical analysis, such as a pure price momentum oscillator or pattern analysis.

    did not generate good signals, but the sixth was a dandy. Chartists should experiment
    with the settings and consider adding trend lines to enhance their analysis. Trend
    line breaks are often earlier than zero line crosses. A trend line also captures
    the direction of the indicator. A rising Chaikin Oscillator reflects a steady
    increase in buying pressure. A falling Chaikin Oscillator reflects a steady increase
    in selling pressure.

- en: Bullish and bearish divergences alert chartists to a momentum shift in buying
    or selling pressure that can foreshadow a trend reversal on the price chart. A
    bullish divergence forms when price moves to new lows and the Chaikin Oscillator
    forms a higher low. This higher low shows less selling pressure. It is important
    to wait for some sort of confirmation, such as an upturn in the indicator or a
    cross into positive territory. A move into positive territory shows upside momentum
    in the Accumulation Distribution Line.

- en: The Fastenal (FAST) chart shows five divergences for the Chaikin Oscillator
    in 2010\. The default settings (3,10) produce a rather sensitive oscillator that
    will generate many divergences. The key is to differentiate the robust signals
    from the bogus signals by waiting for confirmation. Even with a bullish divergence,
    selling pressure outweighs buying pressure until there is a cross above the zero
    line. Buying pressure dominates until there is a cross into negative territory.

    forms a lower low for a bullish divergence. The green dotted lines show when the
    indicator moves into positive territory to confirm the signal. The mid-February,
    early September and late November signals were great. The mid-June buy signal
    would have resulted in a whipsaw and there was not much weakness after the October
    sell signal from the bearish divergence.

- en: A bearish divergence forms when price moves to a new high and the Chaikin Oscillator
    fails to confirm this higher high. This failure reflects less buying pressure
    that can sometimes foreshadow a bearish reversal on the price chart. Confirmation
    comes when the oscillator moves into negative territory.

- en: The chart for Kohls (KSS) shows three bearish divergences and two bullish divergences
    over a 12 month period. The bearish divergences (red lines) were confirmed when
    the Chaikin Oscillator moved into negative territory to show actual downside momentum
    in the Accumulation Distribution Line. Remember, the Chaikin Oscillator (3,10)
    turns negative when the 3-day EMA of the Accumulation Distribution Line moves
    below the 10-day EMA.

- en: The Chaikin Oscillator is a momentum indicator for the Accumulation Distribution
    Line. Basically, the Chaikin Oscillator turbo charges the Accumulation Distribution
    Line by measuring momentum. Signals are more frequent and often easier to quantify
    using the Chaikin Oscillator. As a money flow oscillator it can be used in conjunction
    with pure price oscillators, such as MACD or [RSI](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:relative_strength_index_rsi
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:relative_strength_index_rsi"). As with all
    indicators, the Chaikin Oscillator should not be used as a stand-alone indicator.

    is placed behind the price plot. Once the indicator is chosen from the dropdown
    list, the default parameter setting appears (3,10). These parameters can be adjusted
