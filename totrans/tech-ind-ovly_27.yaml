- en: The Correlation Coefficient is a statistical measure that reflects the correlation
    between two securities. In other words, this statistic tells us how closely one
    security is related to the other. The Correlation Coefficient is positive when
    both securities move in the same direction, up or down. The Correlation Coefficient
    is negative when the two securities move in opposite directions. Determining the
    relationship between two securities is useful for analyzing intermarket relationships,
    sector/stock relationships, and sector/market relationships. This indicator can
    also help investors diversify by identifying securities with a low or negative
    correlation to the stock market.

- en: The calculation for the Correlation Coefficient is rather complicated so feel
    free to skip this section. We will simply look at the basics to see some of the
    method behind the madness. This indicator is right at the heart of classical statistics.
    The first step is to select two securities. In this example, we will be using
    Intel (INTC) and the Nasdaq 100 ETF (QQQ). Namely, we want to see the degree of
    correlation between Intel and QQQ. The excel table below lays out the groundwork.

    Coefficient. The Excel formula is shown alongside the long formula. As the results
    show, over the 20 day period from June 22nd to July 20th, Intel showed a strong
    positive correlation (+.95) with the Nasdaq 100 ETF.

- en: The Correlation Coefficient oscillates between -1 and +1\. It is not a momentum
    oscillator though. Instead, it moves from periods of positive correlation to periods
    negative correlation. +1 is considered perfect positive correlation, which is
    rare. Anything between 0 and +1 indicates that two securities move in the same
    direction. The degree of positive correlation is likely to vary over time. Oil
    stocks and oil are positively correlated most of the time. The example below shows
    the Energy SPDR (XLE) with Spot Light Crude ($WTIC). Unsurprisingly, the 20-day
    Correlation Coefficient remains largely positive with regular forays above +.75\.
    There is clearly a positive relationship between these two securities. In general,
    anything above .50 shows a strong positive correlation.

    which is rare. Anything between 0 and -1 indicates that two securities move in
    opposite directions. The degree of negative correlation is likely to vary over
    time. Gold and the Dollar are the first two securities that come to mind for a
    negative correlation. The chart below shows Spot Gold Spot ($GOLD) with the US
    Dollar Index ($USD). Although the Correlation Coefficient spends a fair amount
    of time in positive territory, it is negative the majority of the time. In general,
    anything below -.50 shows a strong negative correlation.

- en: The Correlation Coefficient can be used to identify non-correlated securities,
    which is important in developing a diversified portfolio. Unsurprisingly, the
    nine S&P sectors are mostly positively correlated with the S&P 500\. However,
    some are more positively correlated than others. For example, the Technology ETF
    (XLK) and the Consumer Discretionary SPDR (XLY) have a strong positive correlation
    with the S&P 500 over the last three years. The Correlation Coefficients below
    are based on 50 days. The consumer discretionary sector dipped below .50 only
    once in the last three years. The technology sector never dipped below .50 as
    techs remained strongly correlated to the market. In contrast, the Correlation
    Coefficient for the consumer staples sector dipped below .50 a few times and the
    Correlation Coefficient for the utilities sector even dipped below zero twice.
    This indicator shows us that the consumer staples and utilities sectors are less
    correlated to the S&P 500 than the consumer discretionary and technology sectors.

    of the stock market. The chart below shows four ETFs that have many periods of
    negative correlation with the stock market (SPY). Notice how the Correlation Coefficients
    dip below zero numerous times. In this example, I am also using the 50-day Correlation
    Coefficient. The 20+ year Bond ETF (TLT) represents bonds, which are negatively
    correlated with stocks most of the time. Gold (red) moves between periods of positive
    and negative correlation. On the whole, it has been more positively correlated
    than negative the last three years. The Yen Trust (green) appears split its time
    between periods of positive and negative correlation. Surprisingly, the US Dollar
    Fund (UUP) shows a propensity to be negatively correlated with the stock market.

- en: The Correlation Coefficient tells us the relationship between two securities.
    Over a given time period, the two securities move together when the Correlation
    Coefficient is positive. Conversely, the two securities move in opposite directions
    when the Correlation Coefficient is negative. The examples above show 20-day and
    50-day Correlation Coefficients. Longer-term investors may use 150 or even 250
    days (one year) for smoother lines that reflect longer-term relationships.

    First, create a chart with the base security entered in the symbol box at the
    top of the chart (INTC). Second, select Correlation Coefficient as an indicator
    in the drop-down menu. Third, enter the symbol for the other security and the
    timeframe in the parameters box ($SPX,20). These two are separated by a comma.
    The example below shows Intel in the main window with the 10-day Correlation Coefficient
    in the indicator window. This shows how Intel correlates to the S&P 500\. Also,
    notice that the S&P 500 price plot (red dashed) is placed behind the Intel price
    plot for comparison. [Click here](http://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=$SPX&p=D&yr=0&mn=6&dy=0&id=p61512839073&listNum=30&a=239762181
