- en: Bollinger BandWidth is an indicator derived from [Bollinger Bands](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:bollinger_bands
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:bollinger_bands"). In his book, *Bollinger
    on Bollinger Bands*, John Bollinger refers to Bollinger BandWidth as one of two
    indicators that can be derived from Bollinger Bands. The other indicator is %B.

- en: BandWidth measures the percentage difference between the upper band and the
    lower band. BandWidth decreases as Bollinger Bands narrow and increases as Bollinger
    Bands widen. Because Bollinger Bands are based on the standard deviation, falling
    BandWidth reflects decreasing volatility and rising BandWidth reflects increasing
    volatility.

- en: Bollinger Bands consist of a middle band with two outer bands. The middle band
    is a [simple moving average](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_averages
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_averages") usually set at 20 periods.
    The outer bands are usually set 2 standard deviations above and below the middle
    band. Settings can be adjusted to suit the characteristics of particular securities
    or trading styles.

- en: When calculating BandWidth, the first step is to subtract the value of the lower
    band from the value of the upper band. This shows the absolute difference. This
    difference is then divided by the middle band, which normalizes the value. This
    normalized Bandwidth can then be compared across different timeframes or with
    the BandWidth values for other securities.

    (volatility). Both rise and fall together. The image below shows a spreadsheet

- en: Narrow BandWidth is relative. BandWidth values should be gauged relative to
    prior BandWidth values over a period of time. It is important to get a good look-back
    period to define BandWidth range for a particular ETF, index or stock. For example,
    an eight to twelve-month chart will show BandWidth highs and lows over a significant
    timeframe. BandWidth is considered narrow as it approaches the lows of this range
    and wide as it approaches the high end.

- en: Securities with low volatility will have lower BandWidth values than securities
    with high volatility. For example, the Utilities SPDR (XLU) represents utility
    stocks, which have relatively low volatility. The Technology SPDR (XLK) represents
    technology stocks, which have relatively high volatilities. Because of lower volatility,
    XLU will have consistently lower BandWidth values than XLK. The 200-day moving
    average of XLU BandWidth is below 5, while the 200-day moving average of XLK BandWidth
    is above 7\.

- en: Bollinger BandWidth is best known for identifying The Squeeze. This occurs when
    volatility falls to a very low level, as evidenced by the narrowing bands. The
    upper and lower bands are based on the standard deviation, which is a measure
    of volatility. The bands narrow as price flattens or moves within a relatively
    narrow range. The theory is that periods of low volatility are followed by periods
    of high volatility. Relatively narrow BandWidth (a.k.a. the Squeeze) can foreshadow
    a significant advance or decline. After a Squeeze, a price surge and subsequent
    band break signal the start of a new move. A new advance starts with a Squeeze
    and subsequent break above the upper band. A new decline starts with a Squeeze
    and subsequent break below the lower band.

- en: Chart 2 shows Alaska Airlines (ALK) with a squeeze in mid-June. After declining
    in April-May, ALK stabilized in early June as Bollinger Bands narrowed. BandWidth
    dipped below 10 to put the Squeeze play on in mid-June. Keep in mind that 10 refers
    to 10%. In other words, the width of the bands is equal to 10% of the middle band.
    Even though this level seems high, it is actually quite low for ALK. With the
    stock around 15-16, BandWidth was less than 10% and at its lowest level in over
    a year. With the subsequent surge above the upper band, the stock broke out to
    trigger an extended advance.

    was added to the indicator window. This line marks 8, which is deemed relatively
    low based on the historical range. The BandWidth indicator alerted traders to
    be ready for a move in mid-August. The stock obliged with a surge above the upper
    band and continued higher throughout September. The advance stalled in late September
    and BandWidth narrowed again in October. Notice how BandWidth declined below the
    lows set in August and then flattened out. The subsequent break below the lower
    Bollinger Band triggered a bearish signal in late October.

- en: The Squeeze can also be applied to weekly charts or longer timeframes. Volatility
    and BandWidth are typically higher on the weekly timeframe than a daily timeframe.
    This makes sense because larger price movements can be expected over longer timeframes.
    Chart 4 shows Barrick Gold (ABX) consolidating throughout 2006 and into 2007\.
    As the consolidation narrowed and a triangle formed, Bollinger Bands contracted
    and BandWidth dipped below 10 in January 2007\. Notice how BandWidth remained
    at low levels as the consolidation extended. A bullish signal triggered with the
    breakout in July 2007\. BandWidth also rose as prices moved sharply in one direction
    and Bollinger Bands widened.

    There was a move to the upper band in May, but no breakout for a signal. Instead,
    HON clearly broke below the lower band to trigger a bearish signal in June 2007.

- en: The BandWidth indicator can be used to identify the Bollinger Band Squeeze.
    This alerts chartists to prepare for a move, but direction depends on the subsequent
    band break. A squeeze followed by a break above the upper band is bullish, while
    a squeeze followed by a break below the lower band is bearish. Be careful of head-fakes
    however. Sometimes the first break fails to hold as prices reverse the other way.
    Strong breaks hold and seldom look back. An upside breakout followed by an immediate
    pullback should serve as a warning.

    parameters (20,2) are based on the default parameters for Bollinger Bands. These
    can be changed accordingly. 20 represents the simple moving average. 2 represents
    the number of standard deviations for the upper and lower band. BandWidth can
    be positioned above, below or behind the price plot. [Click here](http://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=SPY&p=D&yr=0&mn=6&dy=0&id=p38029592805&listNum=30&a=195096097

    "http://stockcharts.com/freecharts/carpet.html") as an example, choose Bollinger
    BandWidth and then click the delta icon (little triangle) to view absolute levels.
    A shaded delta icon shows percentage change. A white delta icon shows absolute
    levels. Green boxes show stocks with relatively wide BandWidth. Light boxes show
    stocks with relatively narrow BandWidth. A list of the stocks with the narrowest
    BandWidth is shown at the bottom right of the Market Carpet (Bottom 5). Click
    the names to see a small chart above. Users can dive into the sectors by clicking
    on the sector heading (e.g. Technology). With nine sectors and the Bottom 5 stocks
    listed for each sector, users can quickly view 45 stocks with relatively narrow
    BandWidth.
