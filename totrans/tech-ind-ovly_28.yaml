- en: The DecisionPoint Price Momentum Oscillator (PMO) is an oscillator based on
    a [Rate of Change (ROC)](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:rate_of_change_roc_and_momentum
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:rate_of_change_roc_and_momentum") calculation
    that is smoothed twice with exponential moving averages that use a custom smoothing
    process. Because the PMO is normalized, it can also be used as a relative strength
    tool. Stocks can thus be ranked by their PMO value as an expression of relative
    strength.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The DecisionPoint Price Momentum Oscillator is derived by taking a one period
    rate of change and smoothing it with two custom smoothing functions. The custom
    smoothing functions are very similar to Exponential Moving Averages but instead
    of adding one to the time period setting to create the smoothing multiplier (as
    in a true EMA), the smoothing functions just use the period by itself.

  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The PMO oscillates in relation to a zero line. Normally, the PMO direction indicates
    if strength is increasing or decreasing, and the steepness of the trend angle
    demonstrates the power behind the move. Since this is an internal ratio calculation
    (versus external, like the standard relative strength calculation, which divides
    one price by another price index), it returns a result that is normalized and
    can be compared to the PMO result of any other security or index. Therefore, chartists
    can rank a list of securities or indexes in relative strength order simply by
    using their PMO values. The list does not have to be homogeneous ­ the PMO can
    be used to rank market indexes, stocks and mutual funds in the same list.

- en: An indicator that looks very similar to the PMO is the MACD ([Moving Average
    Convergence-Divergence](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_average_convergence_divergence_macd
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_average_convergence_divergence_macd"))
    indicator invented by Gerald Appel. The main difference between the PMO and MACD
    is the absolute value of each indicator. The MACD is based on moving average calculations,
    and one MACD reading bears no relationship whatsoever to another; whereas the
    PMO, as explained above, is an internal ratio. The chart below shows the PMO and
    MACD together.

    of the ratio-type calculation for the PMO is evident on longer-term charts because
    the PMO is fairly constant, unlike the MACD. See the weekly and monthly charts
    below.

- en: As demonstrated below, the PMO can help determine if a price index is overbought
    or oversold. Below is a five-year chart of the S&P 500 Index showing a wide range
    of extreme market conditions. The normal PMO range for this index is from about
    +2.5 (overbought) to -2.5 (oversold), and, when the PMO approaches or breaches
    those limits, it often signals a price reversal. When the PMO changes direction
    at or beyond the extremes of its normal range, it is a fairly reliable indication
    that an intermediate-term change in price direction is taking place.

    price index will have its own “signature” range. For example, the chart of Microsoft
    (MSFT) below shows a range of +5.0 to -5.0\. Always check a longer-term chart
    to verify the normal range for the index you are analyzing.

    number of time periods within the timeframe being addressed, so a monthly PMO
    looks completely different from a daily PMO. See the monthly based chart below
    which uses the same seven-year period as the daily MSFT chart above.

    movement. In this regard, it is like other momentum indicators. On the chart of
    the Gold ETF (GLD) below, the strongest moves in either direction are characterized
    by straight, steep, smooth PMO movement. More halting trends usually are accompanied
    by frequent PMO direction changes. PMO bottoms and tops suggest that price momentum
    has shifted direction, so they can provide early flags to price tops and bottoms.
    They are usually more reliable when the PMO is in overbought or oversold territory.

    changes by forming divergences against the price index. Three separate divergences
    have been highlighted below. The two negative divergences (red lines) warn of
    important tops as the price index makes a higher high, and the PMO makes a lower
    high. The Positive divergence (green lines) signal an important bottom with price
    making a lower low while the PMO makes a higher low.

    These signals tend to be short-term in duration, but they can last for several
    weeks. Do not take them at face value because they can whipsaw quite a bit. They
    should be used to alert you to possible trading opportunities not used as a mechanical
    trading model. Always check the chart to verify the price pattern and the configuration
    of the PMO. Signals are best when price appears extended, is near support or resistance,
    and the PMO is very overbought or oversold. These signals may also be used with
    DecisionPoint [Trend Analysis](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:trading_strategies:decisionpoint_trend_model
    "chart_school:trading_strategies:decisionpoint_trend_model") using 20/50/200-EMA
    crossovers which determine long-term, intermediate-term and short-term bull or
    bear bias.

    signals have been highlighted on the chart below:'

- en: The following chart illustrates a common PMO formation that emphasizes why all
    PMO crossover signals cannot be taken literally. The area circled in red is typical
    of PMO movement during a steady rising price trend. There is little volatility
    in price movement, so the PMO moves sideways. The fact that the PMO remains above
    the zero line testifies to the strength of the price move; however, minor zigzags
    in price movement cause the PMO to whipsaw above and below its 10-EMA, generating
    many unprofitable crossover bull signals. This chart also shows how sideways wiggle
    ultimately will end and how it can offer subtle clues that the end of the trend
    is near.

- en: The “bear kiss” is the final part of three distinct topping actions often displayed
    by the PMO. When we see this classic formation, it offers additional reassurance
    that a tradable top is in place. We start looking for this formation when the
    PMO has become relatively overbought and the price index has experienced a substantial
    move up. This formation doesn't always occur at tops, but, when it does, it helps
    build our confidence in the reliability of the signal.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first action is a false PMO top. Major tops are always accompanied by an
    overbought PMO top, but all PMO tops do not signal major price tops. The false
    top alerts us that a price top is probably just a few weeks away.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Next we'll see a slightly higher PMO top followed by a crossover sell signal,
    which is generated when the PMO (blue line) crosses down through its 10-EMA (green
    line). When these signals occur at very overbought levels, they may tentatively
    be taken at face value, but, when they have been preceded by very strong price
    action, it is possible for prices to make yet another new high, which causes the
    PMO to begin rising again.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, as prices roll over from the final top, the PMO turns up again, this
    time topping after just barely “kissing” the underside of the 10-EMA. Some refer
    to this as the “kiss of death,” but this seems a tad dramatic, so a bear kiss
    seems more appropriate. Besides, there is a reciprocal formation at important
    bottoms, and the term “bull kiss” seems more apt than “kiss of life.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Note that an important aspect of this analysis is that the price index has broken
    a rising trend line in conjunction with the bear kiss.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The “bull kiss” occurs shortly after a PMO crossover buy signal, and is the
    result of a price pullback after the initial up thrust that generates the crossover
    signal. While the bull kiss and bear kiss are essentially equal but opposite formations,
    price behavior between the two is different. Normally, the bear kiss is a non-confirmation
    which coincides with the final price high in a rally; whereas, the bull kiss normally
    coincides with a higher price low in a new rally.

- en: '**CLEAN SIGNALS**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While the bull and bear kiss formations are quite common, it is also possible
    to have very clean PMO reversals and crossovers without any of the gyrations associated
    with blow-offs and retests because the change in price trend is relatively smooth.
    The point is that reversals and crossover actions can cover a wide range of configurations.
    A study of the charts will lead to a better understanding of the kind of price
    action that begets a certain type of PMO behavior. The PMO behavior also gives
    clues as to what kind of price behavior to expect.
