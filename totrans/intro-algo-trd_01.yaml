    a trader.  Visions of computer programs running wild, buying and selling with
    reckless abandon, are a common nightmare.  A trader goes to sleep flat, and wakes
    up to find a rogue robot algorithm frittered away his or her account, buying and
    selling all night, due to a simple programming bug.

    Horror stories abound of these sorts of account killing computer codes.  These
    exact nightmare scenarios have happened.  But, properly designed algos can also
    be friendly, too.

    the different types of trading.  That will help you understand what an algo is,
    what it can do, and most importantly, what it cannot do.

    means traders use some sort of judgment to enter and exit trades.

    to buy some.  That is discretionary trading.

    indicators, trendlines, moving averages, etc.  Or it may be naked, except for
    price data.  Once that trader makes a trade decision based on all she sees, that
    is a discretionary trade.

    buy and sell orders along with prices.  He trades based on this tool.  He is likely
    a discretionary trader, too.

    certain trades, and why they avoided taking other trades (that may have looked
    exactly the same), they might give you a “deer in the headlights” look, or a vague
    response like “I don’t know, it just felt right!”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    not follow these rules, and they may not be consistent in applying these rules. 
    Heck, they might not even be able to describe the rules that caused them to trade.

    He was calling the market live, and it went something like this: “yes, the market
    is looking weak, and there is a short setup here that I usually take, so I am
    just waiting for a short entry…waiting…waiting…no, it’s a long trade!  I just
    got out with a profit!”'

    point is that he was trading (likely simulated trading) in a discretionary fashion.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Discretionary trading, then, involves trading decisions that involve some degree
    of human judgment.  Maybe it is intuition, or a sixth sense, or even random guessing,
    but the trade selection usually includes something that can’t quite be defined
    or tested.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now, that type of trading might sound wrong to you (“who trades based on intuition?”)
    or it may sound appealing (“great, I get to use my brain to help me decide!”). 
    But the fact is many people do it, and some people are successful at it.  It is
    a legitimate way to trade.

    I dove into algo trading.

    extremely complicated, too.  There are traders with single algorithms that run
    25,000 lines of code or more – real rocket science stuff!

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 1.  They can be tested.  Most algorithms can be historically tested, commonly
    referred to as a backtest.  This turns out to be a major advantage of creating
    algorithms, which I’ll describe later.  For algos that cannot be historically
    tested, they almost always can be live tested in simulation mode, with proper
    precautions and some caveats.  In either case, the trader can usually determine
    the acceptability of the strategy BEFORE trading it with real money.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 2.  Algorithms are rigidly defined.  If the algorithm sees a long setup today,
    it will tell you to go long.  If it sees that same setup tomorrow, it will tell
    you to go long again.  The algo only looks at what it was programmed to look at. 
    It doesn’t care what the Fed thinks, does not care about the news, and does not
    care that Jim Cramer screamed that a certain stock was a buy last night – unless,
    of course, you program those types of rules into your algorithm.  The algo is
    consistent in how it follows the rules.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many traders speak of “black boxes,” a special type of algorithm.  With black
    boxes, the rules (the algorithm) remain hidden to the trader.  He or she only
    gets the entry and exit signals, and has no idea how those signals were produced.
  prefs: []

    that approach.  It is really hard to interfere with computer code you cannot even

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: -  A retail trader, trading at home.  He works full time, so trading is his
    hobby.  Every night, he downloads the latest prices, calculates his signals either
    by hand or on a computer, and places trades according to the rules.  He may or
    may not check positions during the day, but since he places orders during non-work
    hours, he knows he is following his strategies each and every day.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: -  A prop trader, trading full time.  He enters and exits trades all day long,
    again according to set rules.  He never, ever deviates from the rules, since he
    knows his boss spot checks his trades for adherence to the rules.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: -  A hedge fund computer code, written by numerous PhDs in math, statistics
    and physics.  The computer code they run has 50,000 lines of code, and does everything
    – enter trades, exits trades, calculates position sizing, automatically performs
    rollovers, etc.  A junior trader is always nearby, monitoring trades in case of
    a malfunction, but the computer controls the show.  The strategies they run can
    be on the order of microseconds (in and out quickly), to day trades of a few hours,
    to swing trades lasting weeks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: -  A professional retail trader, using a standard retail platform, Tradestation. 
    He creates strategies, then lets Tradestation run those strategies automated. 
    He is usually closely monitoring positions, because as Tradestation personnel
    say “automated trading does not mean unattended trading.”  He can trade quite
    a few automated strategies, assuming he has enough capital, and if his strategies
    are diversified enough.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What makes these people algorithmic traders is that they follow strict rules
    for entry and exit.  That is the real key – they are 100% rule followers.  With
    those strict rules, they can historically backtest their approaches, and while
    “past performance is not indicative of future results” (as a U.S. government disclaimer
    correctly states), it is very nice to realize that the strategies traded have
    worked in the past.

  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Entries and exits are both well defined by rules, but the trader has discretion
    to overrule.  For example, a trader might decide to ignore long stock signals
    after a natural or manmade disaster.  Or a trader might decide to go flat before
    major world events (Brexit vote, Trump election night).
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The advantage in hybrid trading is that the trader can still have some discretionary
    influence on the trade.  That is also a disadvantage!  One thing I have noticed
    with my own algo trading is that some of my best algo trades turn out to be ones
    that my “human judgment” absolutely hated!  If I treated those trades as hybrid
    trades, I would have negated all the good effects of the algo.

    out there doing, and how can I possibly compete with them?”  Great question! 
    Pros are using all of the methods detailed above.  You can compete by treating
    trading as a serious endeavor.  Don’t wish for “I have 15 minutes a day for trading”
    type systems.  Wish for being the best you can be at trading – then you’ll be
    good competition for the pros.

    you.  Throughout the book, I’ll discuss some of the characteristics and traits
    that make for good algorithmic traders, but for now I will assume that you already
    know algo trading is the path you want to pursue.  If you still aren’t sure, though,
    keep reading and maybe by the end of the book you will be sure!
