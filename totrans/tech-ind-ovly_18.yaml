- en: The Average Directional Index (ADX), Minus Directional Indicator (-DI) and Plus
    Directional Indicator (+DI) represent a group of directional movement indicators
    that form a trading system developed by Welles Wilder. Although Wilder designed
    his Directional Movement System with commodities and daily prices in mind, these
    indicators can also be applied to stocks.

    Movement System. Wilder determined directional movement by comparing the difference

    over time. These two indicators are often referred to collectively as the Directional
    Movement Indicator (DMI).

    averages of the difference between +DI and -DI, and measures the ***strength***

    Directional Movement (+DM). The second pairing shows an outside day with Minus
    Directional Movement (-DM) getting the edge. The third pairing shows a big difference
    between the lows for a strong Minus Directional Movement (-DM). The final pairing
    shows an inside day, which amounts to no directional movement (zero). Both Plus
    Directional Movement (+DM) and Minus Directional Movement (-DM) are negative and
    revert to zero, so they cancel each other out. All inside days will have zero
    directional movement.

    and it is important to understand the effects. Because of Wilder's smoothing techniques,
    it can take around 150 periods of data to get true ADX values. Wilder uses similar
    smoothing techniques with his RSI and Average True Range calculations. ADX values
    using only 30 periods of historical data will not match ADX values using 150 periods
    of historical data. ADX values with 150 days or more of data will remain consistent.

    somewhere so the first value is simply the sum of the first 14 periods. As shown

- en: The Average Directional Index (ADX) is used to measure the strength or weakness
    of a trend, not the actual direction. Directional movement is defined by +DI and
    -DI. In general, the bulls have the edge when +DI is greater than -DI, while the
    bears have the edge when -DI is greater. Crosses of these directional indicators
    can be combined with ADX for a complete trading system.

    commodity and currency trader. The examples in his books are based on these instruments,
    not stocks. This does not mean his indicators cannot be used with stocks. Some
    stocks have price characteristics similar to commodities, which tend to be more
    volatile with short and strong trends. Stocks with low volatility may not generate
    signals based on Wilder's parameters. Chartists will likely need to adjust the
    indicator settings or the signal parameters according to the characteristics of
    the security.

    if a security is trending or not. This determination helps traders choose between
    a trend-following system or a non-trend-following system. Wilder suggests that
    a strong trend is present when ADX is above 25 and no trend is present when below
    20\. There appears to be a gray zone between 20 and 25\. As noted above, chartists
    may need to adjust the settings to increase sensitivity and signals. ADX also
    has a fair amount of lag because of all the smoothing techniques. Many technical
    analysts use 20 as the key level for ADX.

    into a strong downtrend. There were two non-trending periods as the stock formed
    a bottom in February and August. A strong trend emerged after the August bottom
    as ADX moved above 20 and remained above 20.

- en: Wilder put forth a simple system for trading with these directional movement
    indicators. The first requirement is for ADX to be trading above 25\. This ensures
    that prices are trending. Many traders, however, use 20 as the key level. A buy
    signal occurs when +DI crosses above -DI. Wilder based the initial stop on the
    low of the signal day. The signal remains in force as long as this low holds,
    even if +DI crosses back below -DI. Wait for this low to be penetrated before
    abandoning the signal. This bullish signal is reinforced if/when ADX turns up
    and the trend strengthens. Once the trend develops and becomes profitable, traders
    will have to incorporate a stop-loss and trailing stop should the trend continue.
    A sell signal triggers when -DI crosses above +DI. The high on the day of the
    sell signal becomes the initial stop-loss.

    indicators. Note that 20 is used instead of 25 to qualify ADX signals. A lower
    setting means more possible signals. The green dotted lines show the buy signals
    and the red dotted lines show the sell signals. Wilder's initial stops were not
    incorporated in order to focus on the indicator signals. As the chart clearly
    shows, there are plenty of +DI and -DI crosses. Some occur with ADX above 20 to
    validate signals. Others occur to invalidate signals. As with most such systems,
    there will be whipsaws, great signals, and bad signals. The key, as always, is
    to incorporate other aspects of technical analysis. For example, the first group
    of whipsaws in September 2009 occurred during a consolidation. Moreover, this
    consolidation looked like a flag, which is a bullish consolidation that forms
    after an advance. It would have been prudent to ignore bearish signals with a
    bullish continuation pattern taking shape. The June 2010 buy signal occurred near
    a resistance zone marked by broken support and the 50-62% retracement zone. It
    would have been prudent to ignore a buy signal so close to this resistance zone.

    "chart_school:technical_indicators:parabolic_sar") could have been used to set
    a trailing stop-loss. Notice that there was no sell signal between the March and
    July buy signals. This is because ADX was not above 20 when -DI crossed above
    +DI in late April.

- en: The Directional Movement System indicator calculations are complex, interpretation
    is straightforward, and successful implementation takes practice. +DI and -DI
    crossovers are quite frequent and chartists need to filter these signals with
    complementary analysis. Setting an ADX requirement will reduce signals, but this
    uber-smoothed indicator tends to filter as many good signals as bad. In other
    words, chartists might consider moving ADX to the back burner and focusing on
    the Directional Movement Indicators (+DI and -DI) to generate signals. These crossover
    signals will be similar to those generated using momentum oscillators. Therefore,
    chartists need to look elsewhere for confirmation help. Volume-based indicators,
    basic trend analysis, and [chart patterns](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:chart_analysis:chart_patterns
    "chart_school:chart_analysis:chart_patterns") can help distinguish strong crossover
    signals from weak crossover signals. For example, chartists can focus on +DI buy
    signals when the bigger trend is up and -DI sell signals when the bigger trend
    is down.

    Average Directional Index (ADX) from the indicator dropdown list. By default,
    the ADX line will be in black, the Plus Directional Indicator (+DI) in green and
    the Minus Directional Indicator (-DI) in red. This makes it easy to identify directional
    indicator crosses. While ADX can be plotted above, below or behind the main price
    plot, it is recommended to plot above or below because there are three lines involved.
    A horizontal line can be added to help identify ADX moves. The chart example below
    also shows the 50-day SMA and Parabolic SAR plotted behind the price plot. The
