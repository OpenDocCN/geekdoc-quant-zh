["```py\nRising SAR\n----------\n\nPrior SAR: The SAR value for the previous period. \n\nExtreme Point (EP): The highest high of the current uptrend. \n\nAcceleration Factor (AF): Starting at .02, AF increases by .02 each time the extreme point makes a new high. AF can reach a maximum of .20, no matter how long the uptrend extends. \n\nCurrent SAR = Prior SAR + Prior AF(Prior EP - Prior SAR)\n13-Apr-10 SAR = 48.28 = 48.13 + .14(49.20 - 48.13)\n\nThe Acceleration Factor is multiplied by the difference between the Extreme Point and the prior period's SAR. This is then added to the prior period's SAR. Note however that SAR can never be above the prior two periods' lows. Should SAR be above one of those lows, use the lowest of the two for SAR. \n\n```", "```py\nFalling SAR\n-----------\n\nPrior SAR: The SAR value for the previous period. \n\nExtreme Point (EP): The lowest low of the current downtrend. \n\nAcceleration Factor (AF): Starting at .02, AF increases by .02 each time the extreme point makes a new low.
