- en: Standard deviation is a statistical term that measures the amount of variability
    or dispersion around an average. Standard deviation is also a measure of volatility.
    Generally speaking, dispersion is the difference between the actual value and
    the average value. The larger this dispersion or variability is, the higher the
    standard deviation. The smaller this dispersion or variability is, the lower the
    standard deviation. Chartists can use the standard deviation to measure expected
    risk and determine the significance of certain price movements.

    QQQQ data. Notice that the 10-period [average](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_averages
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_averages") is calculated after the 10th
    period and this average is applied to all 10 periods. Building a running standard
    deviation with this formula would be quite intensive. Excel has an easier way
    with the STDEVP formula. The table below shows the 10-period standard deviation
    using this formula. Here's [an Excel Spreadsheet](/school/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=chart_school:technical_indicators_and_overlays:std_dev_volatility:cs-stddev.xls

- en: Standard deviation values are dependent on the price of the under security.
    Securities with high prices, such as Google (±550), will have higher standard
    deviation values than securities with low prices, such as Intel (±22). These higher
    values are not a reflection of higher volatility, but rather a reflection of the
    actual price. Standard deviation values are shown in terms that relate directly
    to the price of the underlying security. Historical standard deviation values
    will also be affected if a security experiences a large price change over a period
    of time. A security that moves from 10 to 50 will most likely have a higher standard
    deviation at 50 than at 10\.

- en: On the chart above, the left scale relates to the standard deviation. Google's
    standard deviation scale extends from 2.5 to 35, while the Intel range runs from
    .10 to .75\. Average price changes (deviations) in Google range from $2.5 to $35,
    while average price changes (deviations) in Intel range from 10 cents to 75 cents.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Despite the range differences, chartists can visually assess volatility changes
    for each security. Volatility in Intel picked up from April to June as the standard
    deviation moved above .70 numerous times. Google experienced a surge in volatility
    in October as the standard deviation shot above 30\. One would have to divide
    the standard deviation by the closing price to directly compare volatility for
    the two securities.

- en: The current value of the standard deviation can be used to estimate the importance
    of a move or set expectations. This assumes that price changes are normally distributed
    with a classic bell curve. Even though price changes for securities are not always
    normally distributed, chartists can still use normal distribution guidelines to
    gauge the significance of a price movement. In a normal distribution, 68% of the
    observations fall within one standard deviation. 95% of the observations fall
    within two standard deviations. 99.7% of the observations fall within three standard
    deviations. Using these guidelines, traders can estimate the significance of a
    price movement. A move greater than one standard deviation would show above average
    strength or weakness, depending on the direction of the move.

    indicator window. There are around 21 trading days in a month and the monthly
    standard deviation was .88 on the last day. In a normal distribution, 68% of the
    21 observations should show a price change less than 88 cents. 95% of the 21 observations
    should show a price change of less than 1.76 cents (2 x .88 or two standard deviations).
    99.7% of the observations should show a price change of less than 2.64 (3 x .88
    or three standard deviations. Price movements that were 1,2 or 3 standard deviations
    would be deemed noteworthy.

    .32 and .88 from mid-August until mid-December. A 250-day moving average can be
    applied to smooth the indicator and find an average, which is around 68 cents.
    Price moves larger than 68 cents were greater than the 250-day SMA of the 21-day
    standard deviation. These above average price movements indicate heightened interest
    that could foreshadow a trend change or mark a breakout.

- en: The standard deviation is a statistical measure of volatility. These values
    provide chartists with an estimate for expected price movements. Price moves greater
    than the Standard deviation show above average strength or weakness. The standard
    deviation is also used with other indicators, such as [Bollinger Bands](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:bollinger_bands
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:bollinger_bands"). These bands are set 2 standard
    deviations above and below a moving average. Moves that exceed the bands are deemed
    significant enough to warrant attention. As with all indicators, the standard
    deviation should be used in conjunction with other analysis tools, such as [momentum
    oscillators](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:introduction_to_technical_indicators_and_oscillators#momentum_oscillators

    parameter of 10\. This parameter can be changed according to analysis needs. Roughly
    speaking, 21 days equals one month, 63 days equals one quarter and 250 days equals
    one year. The standard deviation can also be used on weekly or monthly charts.
    Indicators can be applied to the standard deviation by clicking advanced options
    and then adding an overlay. [Click here](http://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=QQQ&p=D&yr=0&mn=6&dy=0&id=p80789045093&listNum=30&a=217969334

    with extremely high volatility. This simple scan searches for S&P 600 stocks that
    are in an uptrend. The final scan clause excludes high volatility stocks from
    the results. Note that the standard deviation is converted to a percentage of
    sorts so that the standard deviation of different stocks can be compared on the
    same scale.
