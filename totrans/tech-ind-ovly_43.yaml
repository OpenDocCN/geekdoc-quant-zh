- en: The Rate-of-Change (ROC) indicator, which is also referred to as simply Momentum,
    is a pure [momentum oscillator](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:introduction_to_technical_indicators_and_oscillators#momentum_oscillators
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:introduction_to_technical_indicators_and_oscillators")
    that measures the percent change in price from one period to the next. The ROC
    calculation compares the current price with the price “n” periods ago. The plot
    forms an oscillator that fluctuates above and below the zero line as the Rate-of-Change
    moves from positive to negative. As a momentum oscillator, ROC signals include
    centerline crossovers, divergences and overbought-oversold readings. Divergences
    fail to foreshadow reversals more often than not so this article will forgo a
    discussion on divergences. Even though centerline crossovers are prone to whipsaw,
    especially short-term, these crossovers can be used to identify the overall trend.
    Identifying overbought or oversold extremes comes naturally to the Rate-of-Change
    oscillator.

- en: As noted above, the Rate-of-Change indicator is momentum in its purest form.
    It measures the percentage increase or decrease in price over a given period of
    time. Think of its as the rise (price change) over the run (time). In general,
    prices are rising as long as the Rate-of-Change remains positive. Conversely,
    prices are falling when the Rate-of-Change is negative. ROC expands into positive
    territory as an advance accelerates. ROC dives deeper into negative territory
    as a decline accelerates. There is no upward boundary on the Rate-of-Change. The
    sky is the limit for an advance. There is, however, a downside limit. Securities
    can only decline 100%, which would be to zero. Even with these lopsided boundaries,
    Rate-of-Change produces identifiable extremes that signal [overbought](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:glossary_o#overbought
    "chart_school:glossary_o") and oversold conditions.

- en: Even though momentum oscillators are best suited for trading ranges or zigzag
    trends, they can also be used to define the overall direction of the underlying
    trend. There are approximately 250 trading days in a year. This can be broken
    down into 125 days per half year, 63 days per quarter and 21 days per month. A
    trend reversal starts with the shortest timeframe and gradually spreads to the
    other timeframes. In general, the long-term trend is up when both the 250-day
    and 125-day Rate-of-Change are positive. This means that prices are higher now
    than they were 12 and 6 months ago. Long positions taken 6 or 12 months ago would
    be profitable and buyers would be happy.

    There have been three big trends in the last three years. The first was up as
    the 250-day Rate-of-Change was largely positive until September 2008 (1). The
    second was down as the indicator turned negative from October 2008 until September
    2009 (2). The third is up as the indicator turned positive in late September 2009
    (3). Even though the big uptrend remains in force, IBM flattened out on the price
    chart and this affected the 125-day and 63-day Rate-of-Change. The 63-day Rate-of-Change
    (quarterly) has been flirting with negative territory since February (4). The
    125-day Rate-of-Change (six-month) dipped into negative territory for the first
    time since April 2009 (5). This shows some deterioration in IBM that serves as
    an alert to watch the stock carefully. A break below the six-month trading range
    would be a bearish development (6).

    oscillators are ideally suited for sideways price action with regular fluctuations.
    This makes it easier to identify extremes and forecast turning points. Security
    prices can also fluctuate when trending. For example, an uptrend consists of a
    series of higher highs and higher lows as prices zigzag higher. Pullbacks often
    occur at regular intervals based on the percentage move, time elapsed or both.
    A downtrend consists of lower lows and lower highs as prices zigzag lower. Counter
    trend advances retrace a portion of the prior decline and usually peak below the
    prior high. Peaks can occur at regular intervals based on the percentage move,
    time elapsed or both. The Rate-of-Change can be used to identify periods when
    the percentage change nears a level that foreshadowed a turning point in the past.'

    Notice how the stock zigzagged up with a series of higher highs and higher lows.
    Because the overall trend was up, the Rate-of-Change indicator was used to identify
    short-term oversold levels as a chance to partake in the bigger uptrend. Short-term
    overbought signals were ignored because the bigger trend was up. Based on the
    May-June bounces, -10% was set as the oversold boundary. Movements below this
    level indicated that prices were at a short-term extreme. Overbought and oversold
    settings depend on the volatility of the underlying security. A more volatile
    stock may use -15% for oversold, while a less volatile stock may use -5%. Oversold
    readings serve as an alert to be ready for a turning point. Prices are oversold,
    but have yet to actually turn. Remember, a security can become oversold and remain
    oversold as the decline continues. A 20-day [moving average](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_averages
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_averages") was overlaid to identify
    an actual upturn. After ROC became oversold in early October, AET moved above
    its 20-day SMA in late October to confirm an upturn (1). The second oversold reading
    occurred in early February and AET moved above its 20-day SMA in late February
    (2).

    2009\. This example uses a 20-day Rate-of-Change to identify oversold levels within
    a bigger downtrend. The number of time periods depends on the individual security
    and the desired trading timeframe. The late December high occurred with an overbought
    reading above +10%. This means Microsoft was up over 10% in a 20-day period, which
    is about a month. That's a pretty good bounce within a bigger downtrend. The next
    overbought reading did not occur until April when the Rate-of-Change again exceeded
    +10%. MSFT broke trend line support in May to signal a continuation of the downtrend.
    The next overbought reading occurred in early August 2008\. It took a while, but
    the stock eventually broke support at 24 in mid-September and again in early October.

    2006 to February 2008\. The 20-day Rate-of-Change indicator sets overbought at
    +10% and oversold at -10%. The overbought and oversold levels identify extremes
    quite well, but timing the actual turn is more difficult because of the volatility.
    The next chart reduces this volatility by using an exponential [moving average](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_averages

    A 30-day EMA has been overlaid as a signal line. Furthermore, the 20-day Rate-of-Change
    is shown with a 5-day SMA to smooth out the fluctuations. There are fewer overbought
    and oversold readings using the 5-day SMA. Focusing only on the buy signals, the
    green dotted line shows when ROC exceeds -10% and the green arrow shows when the
    10-day EMA crosses above the 30-day SMA. The oversold readings are usually early,
    but the moving average crossovers are usually late. Such is life with technical
    analysis. The point here is to reduce whipsaws by smoothing the data. A 10-day
    EMA was used because it is faster than a 10-day SMA. A 30-day SMA was used because
    it is slower than a 30-day EMA. Speeding up the shorter moving average and slowing
    down the longer moving average makes for slightly quicker signals.

- en: The Rate-of-Change oscillator measures the speed at which prices are changing.
    An upward surge in the Rate-of-Change reflects a sharp price advance. A downward
    plunge indicates a steep price decline. Even though chartists can look for bullish
    and bearish divergences, these formations can be misleading because of sharp moves.
    Sustained advances often start with a big surge out of the gate. Subsequent advances
    are usually less sharp and this causes a bearish divergence to form in the Rate-of-Change
    oscillator. It is important to remember that prices are constantly increasing
    as long as the Rate-of-Change remains positive. Positive readings may be less
    than before, but a positive Rate-of-Change still reflects a price increase, not
    a price decline. Like all technical indicator, the Rate-of-Change oscillator should
    be used in conjunction with other aspects of technical analysis.

    price plot. Once the indicator is chosen from the dropdown list, the default parameter
    setting appears (12). This parameter can be adjusted to increase or decrease sensitivity.
    Users can add a moving average by clicking “advanced options” and choosing an
    overlay. A moving average can be used as a signal line or to simply smooth the
    data. Horizontal lines can also be added to mark overbought or oversold levels.
