- en: 'Developed by Tushar Chande in 1995, Aroon is an indicator system that determines
    whether a stock is trending or not and how strong the trend is. “Aroon” means
    “Dawn''s Early Light” in Sanskrit. Chande chose this name because the indicators
    are designed to reveal the beginning of a new trend. The Aroon indicators measure
    the number of periods since price recorded an x-day high or low. There are two
    separate indicators: Aroon-Up and Aroon-Down. A 25-day Aroon-Up measures the number
    of days since a 25-day high. A 25-day Aroon-Down measures the number of days since
    a 25-day low. In this sense, the Aroon indicators are quite different from typical
    [momentum oscillators](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:introduction_to_technical_indicators_and_oscillators#momentum_oscillators
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:introduction_to_technical_indicators_and_oscillators"),
    which focus on price relative to time. Aroon is unique because it focuses on time
    relative to price. Chartists can use the Aroon indicators to spot emerging trends,
    identify consolidations, define correction periods and anticipate reversals.'

    100\. Aroon-Up is based on price highs, while Aroon-Down is based on price lows.
    These two indicators are plotted side-by-side for easy comparison. The default
    parameter setting in SharpCharts is 25 and the example below is based on 25 days.

- en: Aroon declines as the elapsed time between a new high or low increases. 50 is
    the cutoff point. Because 12.5 days marks the exact middle, a reading of exactly
    50 is impossible on a daily chart. It is possible with other timeframes. On daily
    charts, Aroon is either below 50 (48) or above 50 (52). A reading above 50 means
    a new high or low was recorded within the last 12 days or less. This is the most
    recent half of the look-back period. A reading below 50 means a new high or low
    was recorded within the last 13 days or more {(25-13)/25 x 100 = 48). This is
    the latter half of the look-back period. The table below shows the range of values
    for 25-day Aroon-Up and 25-day Aroon-Down

- en: The Aroon indicators fluctuate above/below a centerline (50) and are bound between
    0 and 100\. These three levels are important for interpretation. At its most basic,
    the bulls have the edge when Aroon-Up is above 50 and Aroon-Down is below 50\.
    This indicates a greater propensity for new x-day highs than lows. The converse
    is true for a downtrend. The bears have the edge when Aroon-Up is below 50 and
    Aroon-Down is above 50\.

- en: A surge to 100 indicates that a trend may be emerging. This can be confirmed
    with a decline in the other Aroon indicator. For example, a move to 100 in Aroon-Up
    combined with a decline below 30 in Aroon-Down shows upside strength. Consistently
    high readings mean prices are regularly hitting new highs or new lows for the
    specified period. Prices are moving consistently higher when Aroon-Up remains
    in the 70-100 range for an extended period. Conversely, consistently low readings
    indicate that prices are seldom hitting new highs or lows. Prices are NOT moving
    lower when Aroon-Down remains in the 0-30 range for an extended period. This does
    not mean prices are moving higher though. For that, we need to check Aroon-Up.

- en: There are three stages to an emerging trend signal. First, the Aroon lines will
    cross. Second, the Aroon lines will cross above/below 50\. Third, one of the Aroon
    lines will reach 100\. For example, the first stage of an uptrend signal is when
    Aroon-Up moves above Aroon-Down. This shows new highs becoming more recent than
    new lows. Keep in mind that Aroon measures the time elapsed, not the price. The
    second stage is when Aroon-Up moves above 50 and Aroon-Down moves below 50\. The
    third stage is when Aroon-Up reaches 100 and Aroon-Down remains at relatively
    low levels. The first and second stages do not always occur in that order. Sometimes
    Aroon-Up will break above 50 and then above Aroon-Down. Reverse engineering the
    uptrend stages will give you the emerging downtrend signal. Aroon-Down breaks
    above Aroon-Up, breaks above 50, and reaches 100\.

    notice that the downtrend began weakening as Aroon-Down declined below 50 at the
    end of 2007 (far left). The first stage of an uptrend was signaled when Aroon-Up
    moved above Aroon-Down in early 2008 (first orange circle). Aroon-Up continued
    above 50 and hit 100 as Aroon-Down remained at relatively low levels. Notice how
    Aroon-Up remained near 100 as the advance continued. This emerging uptrend signal
    lasted until September 2008 when Aroon-Down broke above Aroon-Up, exceeded 50
    and surged to 100 (second orange circle). Notice how Aroon-Down remained near
    100 as the downtrend extended. The third trend on this chart was signaled when
    Aroon-Up surged to 100 in June 2009 and remained above 50 for over a year (third
    orange circle). Also, notice that Aroon-Down remained below 50 for over a year.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Aroon indicators signal a consolidation when both are below 50 and/or both
    are moving lower with parallel lines. It makes sense that consistent readings
    below 50 are indicative of flat trading. For 25-day Aroon, readings below 50 mean
    a 25-day high or low has not been recorded in 13 or more days. Prices are clearly
    flat when not recording new highs or new lows. Similarly, a consolidation is usually
    forming when both Aroon-Up and Aroon-Down move lower in parallel fashion and the
    distance between the two lines is quite small. This narrow parallel decline indicates
    that some sort of trading range is forming. The first Aroon indicator to break
    above 50 and hit 100 will trigger the next signal.

    in a parallel decline. The width of the channel could be narrower, but we can
    see the consolidation taking shape on the price chart for confirmation. Both Aroon-Up
    and Aroon-Down were below 50 in the yellow area. Aroon-Up then broke out and surged
    to 100, which was before the breakout. Further confirmation came with another
    Aroon-Up surge at the breakout point. This surge/breakout signaled the end of
    the consolidation and the beginning of the advance.

    moved lower in May with a parallel decline. The distance between the lines was
    around 25 points throughout the decline. Aroon-Up and Aroon-Down flattened in
    June and both remained below 50 for around two weeks as the triangle consolidation
    extended. Aroon-Down (red) was the first to make its move with a break above 50
    just before the triangle break on the price chart. Aroon-Down hit 100 as prices
    broke triangle support to signal a continuation lower.

- en: '**Aroon-Up and Aroon-Down are complementary indicators that measure the elapsed
    time between new x-day highs and lows, respectively.** They are shown together
    so chartists can easily identify the stronger of the two and determine the trend
    bias. A surge in Aroon-Up combined with a decline in Aroon-Down signals the emergence
    of an ***uptrend***. Conversely, a surge in Aroon-Down combined with a decline
    in Aroon-Up signals the start of a ***downtrend***. A consolidation is present
    when both move lower in parallel fashion or when both remain at low levels (below
    30). Chartists can use the Aroon indicators to determine if a security is trending
    or trading flat and then use other indicators to generate appropriate signals.
    For example, chartists might use a [momentum oscillator](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:introduction_to_technical_indicators_and_oscillators#momentum_oscillators
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:introduction_to_technical_indicators_and_oscillators")
    to identify oversold levels when 25-week Aroon indicates that the long-term trend
    is up.'
