- en: Keltner Channels are volatility-based envelopes set above and below an exponential
    moving average. This indicator is similar to Bollinger Bands, which use the standard
    deviation to set the bands. Instead of using the standard deviation, Keltner Channels
    use the [Average True Range (ATR)](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:average_true_range_atr
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:average_true_range_atr") to set channel distance.
    The channels are typically set two Average True Range values above and below the
    20-day EMA. The exponential moving average dictates direction and the Average
    True Range sets channel width. **Keltner Channels are a trend following indicator
    used to identify reversals with channel breakouts and channel direction.** Channels
    can also be used to identify overbought and oversold levels when the trend is
    flat.

- en: In his 1960 book, How to Make Money in Commodities, Chester Keltner introduced
    the “Ten-Day Moving Average Trading Rule,” which is credited as the original version
    of Keltner Channels. This original version started with a 10-day SMA of the typical
    price {(H+L+C)/3)} as the centerline. The 10-day SMA of the High-Low range was
    added and subtracted to set the upper and lower channel lines. Linda Bradford
    Raschke introduced the newer version of Keltner Channels in the 1980s. Like Bollinger
    Bands, this new version used a volatility based indicator, Average True Range
    (ATR), to set channel width. StockCharts.com uses this newer version of Keltner
    Channels.

    for the exponential moving average. Second, choose the time periods for the Average
    True Range (ATR). Third, choose the multiplier for the Average True Range.

- en: The example above is based on the default settings for SharpCharts. Because
    moving averages lag price, a longer moving average will have more lag and a shorter
    moving average will have less lag. ATR is the basic volatility setting. Short
    timeframes, such as 10, produce a more volatile ATR that fluctuates as 10-period
    volatility ebbs and flows. Longer timeframes, such a 100, smooth these fluctuations
    to produce a more constant ATR reading. The multiplier has the most effect on
    the channel width. Simply changing from 2 to 1 will cut channel width in half.
    Increasing from 2 to 3 will increase channel width by 50%.

    the central moving average. This particular technique has been advocated by Kerry

    years.

    blue and a narrower channel in green. The blue channels were set three Average
    True Range values above and below (3 x ATR). The green channels used one ATR value.
    All three share the 20-day EMA, which is the dotted line in the middle. The indicator
    windows show differences in the Average True Range (ATR) for 10 periods, 50 periods
    and 100 periods. Notice how the short ATR (10) is more volatile and has the widest
    range. In contrast, 100-period ATR is much smoother with a less volatile range.

- en: Indicators based on channels, bands and envelopes are designed to encompass
    most price action. Therefore, moves above or below the channel lines warrant attention
    because they are relatively rare. Trends often start with strong moves in one
    direction or another. A surge above the upper channel line shows extraordinary
    strength, while a plunge below the lower channel line shows extraordinary weakness.
    Such strong moves can signal the end of one trend and the beginning of another.

    "chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_averages") as its foundation, Keltner
    Channels are a trend following indicator. As with moving averages and trend following
    indicators, Keltner Channels lag price action. The direction of the moving average
    dictates the direction of the channel. In general, a downtrend is present when
    the channel moves lower, while an uptrend exists when the channel moves higher.
    The trend is flat when the channel moves sideways.

    an uptrend. A channel downturn and break below the lower trendline can signal
    the start a downtrend. Sometimes a strong trend does not take hold after a channel
    breakout and prices oscillate between the channel lines. Such trading ranges are
    marked by a relatively flat moving average. The channel boundaries can then be
    used to identify overbought and oversold levels for trading purposes.

- en: There are two differences between Keltner Channels and Bollinger Bands. First,
    Keltner Channels are smoother than [Bollinger Bands](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:bollinger_bands
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:bollinger_bands") because the width of the
    Bollinger Bands is based on the standard deviation, which is more volatile than
    the Average True Range (ATR). Many consider this a plus because it creates a more
    constant width. This makes Keltner Channels well suited for trend following and
    trend identification. Second, Keltner Channels also use an exponential moving
    average, which is more sensitive than the simple moving average used in Bollinger
    Bands. The chart below shows Keltner Channels (blue), Bollinger Bands (pink),
    Average True Range (10), Standard Deviation (10) and Standard Deviation (20) for
    comparison. Notice how the Keltner Channels are smoother than the Bollinger Bands.
    Also, notice how the Standard Deviation covers a larger range than the Average
    True Range (ATR).

    Keltner Channels turn up and the stock surges above the upper channel line. ADM
    was in a clear downtrend in April-May as prices continued to pierce the lower
    channel. With a strong thrust up in June, prices exceeded the upper channel and
    the channel turned up to start a new uptrend. Notice that prices held above the
    lower channel on dips in early and late July.

    or better entry point to improve the reward-to-risk ratio. Momentum oscillators
    or other indicators can then be employed to define oversold readings. This chart
    shows [StochRSI](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:stochrsi
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:stochrsi"), one of the more sensitive momentum
    oscillators, dipping below .20 to become oversold at least three times during
    the uptrend. The subsequent crosses back above .20 signaled a resumption of the
    uptrend.

    near the 20-day EMA (middle line) from mid-May until early August. The inability
    to even come close to the upper channel line showed strong downside pressure.

    momentum oscillator to identify short-term overbought conditions. A move above
    100 is considered overbought. A subsequent move back below 100 signals a resumption
    of the downtrend. This signal worked well until September. These failed signals
    indicated a possible trend change that was subsequently confirmed with a break
    above the upper channel line.

    can use the Keltner Channels to identify overbought and oversold levels. A trading
    range can be identified with a flat moving average and the Average Directional
    Index (ADX). The chart below shows IBM fluctuating between support in the 120-122
    area and resistance in the 130-132 area from February to late September. The 20-day
    EMA, middle line, lagged price action, but flattened out from April to September.

    falling ADX shows a weak trend. High and rising ADX shows a strong trend. ADX
    was below 40 the entire time and below 30 most of the time. This reflects the
    absence of a trend. Also, notice that ADX peaked in early June and fell until
    late August.

    Keltner Channels to anticipate reversals. In addition, notice that the channel
    lines often coincide with chart support and resistance. IBM dipped below the lower
    channel line three times from late May until late August. These dips provided
    low-risk entry points. The stock did not manage to reach the upper channel line,
    but did get close as it reversed in the resistance zone. The Disney chart shows
    a similar situation.

    can identify the trend to establish a trading preference. Bullish trades are favored
    in an uptrend and bearish trades are favored in a downtrend. A flat trend requires
    a more nimble approach because prices often peak at the upper channel line and
    trough at the lower channel line. As with all analysis techniques, Keltner Channels

    average, Keltner Channels should be shown on top of a price plot. Upon selecting
    the indicator from the dropdown box, the default setting will appear in the parameters
    window (20,2.0,10). The first number (20) sets the periods for the exponential
    moving average. The second number (2.0) is the ATR multiplier. The third number
    (10) is the number of periods for Average True Range (ATR). These default parameters
    set the channels 2 ATR values above/below the 20-day EMA. Users can change the
