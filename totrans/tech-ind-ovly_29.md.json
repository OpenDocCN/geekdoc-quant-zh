["```py\nPrice {X/2 + 1} periods ago less the X-period simple moving average.\n\nX refers to the number of periods used to calculate the Detrended Price \nOscillator. A 20-day DPO would use a 20-day SMA that is displaced by 11 \nperiods {20/2 + 1 = 11}. This displacement shifts the 20-day SMA 11 days to the left, which actually puts it in the middle of the look-back \nperiod. The value of the 20-day SMA is then subtracted from the price\nin the middle of this look-back period. In short, DPO(20) equals price\n11 days ago less the 20-day SMA.  \n\n```"]
