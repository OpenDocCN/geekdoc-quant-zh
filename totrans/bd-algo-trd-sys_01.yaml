    already in California, living a young single man’s dream. A year or so out of
    college, I was residing in sunny Manhattan Beach, California, with a small apartment
    three blocks from the soft white sand so wonderful that they used it to help create
    Waikiki Beach in Hawaii. I had graduated the year before, summa cum laude, with
    a bachelor’s degree in aerospace engineering from the University of Michigan,
    a top-tier engineering school. Then I had turned my back on Massachusetts Institute
    of Technology (MIT), California Institute of Technology (Cal Tech), Stanford University,
    Purdue University, and Michigan, all of whom had accepted me in their aerospace
    master’s degree program. I turned down those great schools to live and work in
    sunny California, a lifelong dream.

    cold winter’s day in Ann Arbor, Michigan, I was walking down South University
    Avenue to one of my final-semester classes. The wind was blowing so hard in my
    face that I actually leaned into the wind to see if it would keep me up. At that
    point, falling face-first onto the ice-covered sidewalk would not have been much
    worse than feeling the stinging wind in my face. What seemed like a gale-force
    wind kept me upright, and then I knew—I did not want, or need, to live where it
    was cold in the winter when aerospace engineering graduates like me were flocking
    to jobs in sunny southern California. My mind was made up. Sun and sand it was.

    and all the entertainment it provided. Driving around the beach cities in my little

    beach life certainly agreed with me, but my choice of career was the wrong one.
    Sure, designing future fighter airplanes and working on secret government projects
    was fulfilling to a degree. But I just didn’t feel like it was my future. I could
    not see myself doing that kind of work for even 5 years, much less a career of
    30 or 40 years. I needed a jolt to wake me up. That jolt came in the form of junk
    mail that appeared in my mailbox one day, and it changed everything.

    Ken laid out the riches that awaited anyone brave enough to trade futures, or
    commodities, as they were more commonly referred to back then.

    investors know, this pattern is a classic chart pattern, as shown in [Figure 1.2](#figure1-2).
    It is easy to find on just about any chart you look at—you can find a profitable
    example or two on most any chart, any instrument, and any time frame.

    the outcome of that pattern. If you try hiding the outcome of a pattern, it becomes
    much more difficult to find the good patterns.

    and shoulders trade you see, you will soon be broke, as shown in [Figure 1.3](#figure1-3).
    Of course, the naive wannabe trader in me was oblivious to this fact.

    periods, the moving average lines were very close together, and seeing crosses
    of lines was exceedingly difficult. Obviously, I had learned little from my head

    a condo in expensive southern California, which took most of my savings, I was
    able to scrape together $5,000 to open an account. Naturally, I was nervous beyond

    to sleep, in my mind thinking I had made $1,500 with my reverse trading system,

    that losing trade, my account was now down $3,000, a 60 percent account loss brought
    on by the triple moving average and reverse triple moving average systems. I had
    had enough. I raised the white flag, called it quits for a while, and decided

    was *You Can’t Lose Trading Commodities* (R. F. Wiest, 1988), by Robert Wiest.
    At the time I read it in the early 1990’s, the book was already over five years
    old, and I remember its being prominently displayed in a local bookstore. I assumed
    this meant it must be a legitimate money maker to still be around after five years.
    This book was all about scale trading. The concept is that you find a commodity
    that is trading near a multiyear low, find a fundamental reason for it to go up
    in the near future, and then buy on a scale down and sell with a small profit.
    Here’s an example: let’s say wheat is currently at a 10-year low of 300 cents
    per bushel. You also hear forecasts the next wheat crop is going to be much smaller
    because of bad weather. Your analysis indicates that over the next 6 months, wheat
    is likely to go up. So you buy wheat at 300 cents, hoping to sell it at 305 cents
    ($250 profit per contract). If the price falls to 290 cents, you buy a second
    contract, hoping to sell that at 295 cents. You continue to add to your position
    every 10 cents down, with a profit target 5 cents above the corresponding entry.
    Ideally, the price will fall a bit, allowing you to buy three or more contracts,
    before it rises to 305, letting you exit with a profit on each contract. Then,
    if the price fell again, you’d just repeat the process, scaling in and scaling
    out.'

    is entirely possible. But winning percentage is really meaningless. What matters
    is the return on account, and the drawdown. And, when done correctly, scale trading
    produces fairly low rates of return (10 to 20 percent), with fairly high drawdowns
    (20 percent or more). This is because you need a lot of capital to keep buying
    on the way down. If you don’t have enough capital, you won’t be able to continue
    buying. Then you won’t be able to cash in on the lucrative oscillations in price.
    Eventually, if the situation gets dire enough, you’ll be hit with a margin call,
    and your scale trading will likely abruptly end.

    lows and set up scales to trade them. I knew I would not be satisfied with only
    10 to 20 percent return, so I had to make some adjustments, the main one being
    trading with a much smaller than recommended account size. This worked great the
    first year I did it. I ended the year with about 90 percent annual return, all

    in scale-trading winner after winner. Of course, the market slapped me around,
    and slapped me hard, for thinking this way. I don’t even recall which commodity
    was the source of pain—it might have been wheat, corn, cotton, or coffee—but one
    of my second-year scales went terribly bad. I lost all my first year’s profits,
    and most of what was left in my account. For me, the book title *You Can’t Lose

    to a losing position works with mutual funds because (1) over time, mutual funds
    almost always go up eventually, and (2) mutual funds are not leveraged. With futures
    like wheat (my personal favorite for the adding-to-losers strategy), the price
    doesn’t necessarily have to go up over a 5- or 10-year period. Price could stay
    depressed for a long time, leaving you with a pile of open, losing trades. Plus,
    for every wheat contract you purchase, you need extra margin, and eventually even
    small price moves become huge swings in your equity. That is what happened to

    to breakeven. I started buying more contracts on the way up, further leveraging
    myself. I was convinced, though, that the low was in, and if that were true, shouldn’t
    I be buying? All told, I was down about $20,000 on the trade now, which was huge
    considering my account size. But the price was up, and I was looking to be king.
    Then came October 13, 1998 (see [Figure 2.2](#figure2-2)).

- en: I remember October 13, 1998, for good and bad reasons. I was in Seattle on business,
    and after the market closed, I saw that wheat had gone up 6 points! Plus, my hometown
    baseball team, the Cleveland Indians, were in the American League Championship
    Series against the dreaded New York Yankees. I watched Game 6 from my hotel room,
    and in the fifth inning, Jim Thome of the Indians hit a grand slam. Things were
    looking up, I thought. My Indians are going to win, and wheat is going up. Somehow,
    my mind linked the fate of wheat and the Indians together.

- en: Of course, you can guess how this story ends. The next inning, the Yankees scored
    three runs, and the Indians lost and were therefore eliminated from the postseason.
    Wheat also slowly and surely fell in price, and with the extra contracts I bought
    during the previous up leg, even a small correction was a killer. By the beginning
    of December, I was down about $70,000 on that trade alone and out of funds I could
    wire to my account. Cookie would have to get toys for her grandkids from someone
    other than me, because I was done trading. At least for a year or two.

    years doing only minor trading, focusing on rebuilding my trading funds. When
    I had enough spare capital, I turned to what I call the “wild man” approach. With
    this approach, I did not need to test or evaluate any idea before trading real
    money with it. If I got a brilliant idea that coffee should go down, I’d sell
    it. If OPEC was discussing stricter quotas, I’d buy crude oil. No real rhyme or
    reason to my method—just crazy trading based on whatever rumor I heard or whatever
    thought floated into my brain. I tried to keep losses small and winners big, but
    for some reason doing things the other way around was psychologically much easier.
    Plus, I still employed some tricks from my earlier trading, such as adding to
    losers. I’m sure my broker liked me, but my account equity did not. My account
    treaded water with this haphazard approach, but after a while I knew there was
    no future in it. Yet I still followed this approach, if you can call it that,
    until the fateful mad cow trade I discussed earlier. That trade and all the circumstances
    surrounding it were a cold slap in the face. I desperately needed to trade differently.

    ideas, looking at software options, determining how to do walk-forward testing

    that is, if the close today is the highest close of the last X bars, then buy
    at the open of the next bar. For short entries, it was vice versa. For exits,
    I employed a simple stop based on average true range, a fixed dollar stop, a moving
    stop as profits accumulated, and a tightening stop that applied only when a big
    open profit occurred. It was a pretty simple system, but my initial results showed
    it worked well. Nothing earth shattering about this strategy’s entries or exits—I
    am sure this approach was been applied by many people before. It is just a simple
    trend-following approach, and as long as some sustained trends develop, the system
    overall will make money.

    (many people say it still is the best, and I still use it as my primary tool,
    but there are many other excellent back-test programs available on the market
    today, too). In addition to making the testing easier, I had much more faith in
    the results. The only problem was that I wanted to utilize walk-forward testing
    (discussed in great detail later), and TradeStation at the time did not support
    that feature. So I was relegated to running optimizations on TradeStation, then
    computing results and manually performing a walk-forward analysis. It was tedious
    work, but at the same time it gave me a solid sense of how walk-forward testing
    actually worked (I suggest your first walk-forward test be done manually to increase
    your understanding.)

    system was good enough. Looking at the performance of past winners, I concluded
    that I had a reasonable chance of finishing in the top three contestants, as long
    as I had an annual return of 100 percent or higher. That was actually my goal;
    it wasn’t to win the contest, since I realized that at the upper end of performance,
    luck would play a role. I could not count on luck to win the contest; all I could
    do was set myself up to be near the top. To achieve 100 percent return over the
    course of a year, I knew I had to accept a very large maximum drawdown. I decided
    I would allow around 75 percent maximum drawdown, which would be ridiculous for
    any normal trader’s account. But, as I’ll discuss in great detail later, your
    goals and expectations should be based on the situation at hand. For a trading
    contest where the only success criterion was return on account, allowing a large
    drawdown makes sense. If, however, the contest were based on return and risk (say
    the winning contestant would have the highest Calmar ratio), I would have approached
    the contest completely differently. This will be discussed in detail later, but

    I tested over 20 to 25 different instruments. Then, upon seeing the actual performance,
    I simply selected the best performers. In other words, I optimized based on market!
    That is a big no-no for good strategy development. For my second mistake, I did
    not run any detailed correlation studies when selecting the portfolio. Rather,
    I simply guessed at what I thought the correlation should be (“Corn and the Nikkei
    Index are probably not correlated, so I can trade both.”). At the time, this seemed
    reasonable, but my experience since that time has taught me that correlations
    sometimes are different than what common sense dictates, and should always be
    examined in a portfolio situation. Even then, it is important to realize that
    even noncorrelated instruments can become correlated during market panics. Thankfully,

    trend in November really helped the account take off. That is really how trend
    trading works—you can have months of flat to down performance, but catching a
    couple of trends can make your whole year. The problem, of course, is that if
    you miss the trend trade—let’s say you give up before the trend shows itself because
    of the numerous false breakout losses, or you don’t have enough money in your

    Eventually, though, I realized the wisdom in Van’s words. The impressive thing
    is not winning a contest—luck, recklessness, and a host of other things can influence
    the final results. The impressive thing is to trade the contest effectively. For
    me, that meant following my system, the one developed specifically to average
    about 100 percent annual return. So don’t be impressed with the performance itself.
    I’m certainly not. What I am impressed with is my discipline in seeing a goal,
    chasing it, and realizing it. That, to me, is the real success.

    of trading—to trade for a living, full time. At least that was always my goal,
    to live the dream. Trader Gary Smith wrote a book with just that title: *Live
    the Dream by Profitably Day Trading Stock Futures* (Advanced Trading Seminars,
    1995). The dream, of course, is whipping the markets every day with your amazing
    strategies, taking as much money out of the market as you need (Want a new car?
    Simple—just double the size of your next trade!), spending your ample free time
    playing with your kids or doing volunteer work, or the typical stereotypical behavior:
    lounging on the beach, margarita in your hand, as bikini-clad women (or hunky
    guys, if that is your preference) stroll by on your private island.'

    incredibly difficult. Anything great worth attaining is always difficult, right?

    I had 3 consecutive years of contest-winning performances. As 2007 ended, I began
    to seriously consider trading as a full-time profession. After all, if I could
    not succeed at it, after all I had been through and all I had accomplished, who
    actually could? So in early 2008, I decided to take the plunge, and trade full
    time for a living. I thought I had it figured all out when I started trading full
    time. Boy was I wrong! I jumped into full-time trading doing some things, some
    things wrong, and many things I’d do differently if I had to do it over.

    computers, etc.), self-confidence will influence your long-term success in full-time
    trading more than most other things. It took me a long time to figure out that
    most of my trading success and failure wasn’t due to having the fastest computer
    or having the Holy Grail of strategies. Rather, the confidence in my trading abilities,
    the confidence in my strategy development, the confidence in my never failing
    optimism in the face of harsh drawdowns would help me survive as a trader. Obviously,
    confidence alone will not get you there—regardless of what some trading gurus
    might say—but at some point, you’ll need confidence to weather a trading storm.
    Be it a major drawdown, many failed strategies, or an inability to develop new
    approaches, sooner or later confidence in your abilities will be required to get
    you through the tough times. After three years of trading contest–winning success,
    I felt I had confidence to succeed. After all, staring each day at three trading
    trophies ([Figure 4.1](#figure4-1)) helped me feel like I was invincible.

    After all, as I’ll demonstrate in a later chapter, being undercapitalized is the
    easiest road to ruin, whether or not you have a great trading strategy. Even a
    breakeven strategy will lead to ruin if your bankroll is smaller than your opponent’s.

    Wow! Looking back on that, I realize I was insane and started with about 10 times
    less than I should have. Another full-time trader friend once told me that every
    successful trader he knew started with $2 to $3 million before embarking on full-time
    trading. As crazy as that amount sounds (I would have scoffed at it six years
    ago when I started full time), I now believe it is reasonable. After all, you
    want your trading account to grow over time, and you want to draw living expenses
    from it, and at the same time you need to survive the inevitable drawdowns. It
    is nearly impossible to accomplish all three on a shoestring-sized account.

    expenses when embarking on full-time trading. Trading is stressful enough without
    worrying about where your next meal or mortgage payment is coming from. You need

    different clearing firms. Brokers do fail from time to time (I was a victim of

    you can still trade even if one broker goes down. Since I trade multiple strategies,
