    whole time. Yet, I will hopefully be trading more than one contract as time goes
    on. This could get confusing—my actual drawdown (with multiple contracts) could
    be a lot bigger than my drawdown limit (based on one contract). I just have to
    remember to calculate the one-contract drawdown, and compare than to the $5,000
    limit. This will be clearer later, when I set up my monitoring system.

    drawdown. This is simple, and pretty robust. If I am trading the system years

    maximum drawdown per contract limit.

    when to quit. I have also examined, but never implemented, a temporary quit point
    based on market volatility. When the market gets super-crazy, it may be best to
    take a break. I don’t think there is a wrong metric or combination of metrics
    to use to decide when to quit trading. There is probably no “one size fits all”
    optimum, either. The key, in my mind, is to select some criteria that you are
    comfortable with, write it down, and then follow it exactly. Then, if your system
    fails, there should be no tears. You knew the system could break, and you quit
    at a preordained spot.

    quit point is when their money runs out. Speaking from personal experience in

    way to quit.

    point, and it is not great either, but is somewhere in between? Maybe it is making
    money, or breaking even, and it is within the bounds of what Monte Carlo simulation
    says is possible. When do you quit, or otherwise cease trading the system? My
    general philosophy is to watch the downside and let the upside take care of itself.
    In this case, I watch the max drawdown and, as long as that is not hit, let the
    system perform. I do this because I never know month to month or year to year
    what particular systems I am trading will do good, which will do bad, and which
    will just tread water. Normally, I’ll just let system be and not turn them off
    or on.

    and cull the underperformers and possibly adjust the position sizing. If capital
    becomes an issue, I might very well stop trading and swap out a mildly profitable
    but underperforming system for a system that I feel has more potential. The analysis
    details are never the same, and I don’t have strict rules on this. I might, for

    I rationalize this by saying the maximum drawdown is a hard, solid, worst-case
    criterion and will not be violated. At the same time, though, other circumstances
    may arise that cause the system to fall out of favor. These circumstances might
    cause me to quit earlier. That is a big gray area, as unfortunately most things

    day and night system, and (2) I will quit trading if my single-contract drawdown
    hits $5,000\. Now I will determine account size. This point is pretty important.
    Too little capital to start, and I may run out of money before the quitting point.
    Too much capital and I will have a lower rate of return, as well as an inefficient
    allocation of capital. Currently, the exchange initial margin on euro currency
    is $2,750\. So, add this to my “quitting point” drawdown, and I get $7,750\. This
    is the minimum account size I should start with. This will allow me to trade up

    orders or otherwise goofs up? Or what if my slippage estimates are way off, and

    detached as much as possible from the strategy performance. One-contract profit-and-loss
    swings won’t impact me or my emotions. Ten contracts, right off the bat, would
    freak me out a bit—I’d be watching the system too much and have too emotion invested
    in it. As profits (hopefully) accumulate, I can add contracts at a comfortable
    level, and not be emotionally disturbed by it. If things go really well, in six
    months or even a year or two, trading 10 contracts at a time with this proven
    system will seem natural to me.

    trading maximum size right off the bat. Edges disappear, so take advantage while
    it exists.” That is a good argument, and I understand the concept. But I also
    know how I best operate, and going “all in” at the start is not good psychologically
    for me. Of course, you should choose the approach that you feel most comfortable
    with.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A final reason I like starting with one contract is that I like the strategy
    to be self-generating—profits will build the account, leading to more contracts,
    building it further, leading to even more contracts, and so on. No profits mean
    no increase in size. That just makes sense to me; why allocate more money to a
    system that isn’t generating profits?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One drawback to this approach is that it can take a long time to add that second
    contract. For example, if you decide to trade one contract for each $10,000 in
    your account, you will have to have 100 percent return to add one contract. Then
    you’ll need another 50 percent gain to add a third contract. That can take a long
    time. Some position-sizing techniques take this into account (fixed ratio sizing
    comes to mind), but these approaches have some negative characteristics I do not
    like. I get around this dilemma by sizing my account for roughly 1.5 to 2 contracts
    at the start. This would be equivalent to starting with $15,000 in the example
    I gave just above. Then, I need only a 50 percent gain to add a second contract.
    This still forces the system to perform well, but at the same time I get contract
    growth sooner. For me, it is a great trade-off.

- en: That pretty much sums it up—many people think there is no emotion involved in
    mechanical trading. Emotions manifest differently in algorithmic trading, as opposed
    to discretionary trading, but they are there, in many different aspects of trading.
    The nice thing about algorithmic trading is that your emotions theoretically should
    not matter for entry and exit signals. The key word, of course, is theoretically.
    In reality, emotions can creep in many different areas of mechanical, 100 percent
    rules-based trading. In this chapter, I’ll point out some of these major areas
    and provide tips for how to minimize their impact because, just as with discretionary
    trading, emotions can really kill the performance of an algorithmic trader.

    This is a pretty good equity curve for a walk-forward test, and it passed the
    incubation test you just ran for a few months. The system is at an equity peak,
    and you are very excited (there is the emotional part!) to begin trading.

- en: At first glance, you see the new high and immediately think, “It is a runaway
    train, I have to get on now!” That is certainly understandable. At some point,
    though, that train will slow down or even reverse direction. It is a terrible
    feeling to start trading a new system at an equity high, only to endure a drawdown
    right off the bat. So maybe it is better to wait for a small pullback in the equity
    curve and then begin trading. Of course, you run the risk of there never being
    a significant pullback, and then think of all the profits you’ll miss out on!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Both approaches, starting at or near a new high, or starting after a pullback,
    have their emotional advantages and disadvantages. On any given system, no one
    really knows the best approach to take. Over many systems, it probably does not
    matter all that much—some strategies will continue being profitable right after
    you start, and other strategies will immediately go into drawdown. For me personally,
    it seems that most systems go immediately into drawdown, but I think that I forget
    about the ones whose equity curve takes off and just remember the immediate drawdown
    systems.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Given the emotional charge inherent in either approach, the simplest thing to
    do is to make a decision for all future systems you start trading and then stick
    to it. For example, you could decide to begin trading after four months of successful
    incubation, regardless of whether the equity curve is at an equity high, recovering
    from a drawdown, or somewhere in between. That way, sometimes you’ll be right,
    and sometimes you’ll be wrong, but it should be an emotionless task to begin trading.
  prefs: []

    is an existing position that needs to be accounted for. Should you wait for the
    next new signal? Or should you enter the current winning or losing position? Again,
    emotion can enter into this decision. As with the equity curve decision, it is
    best to decide up front and keep emotion out of it.
  prefs: []

    your trading style. Some automated platforms may have trouble recognizing a manually
    entered position. This could lead to your exit signal’s not being triggered. If
    this is the case with your software, it is best to just wait for the next fresh
    entry signal.
  prefs: []

    fast-paced day-trading system, with multiple trades per day, the answer is easy:
    just wait for the next entry signal. Since they happen often, there will be little
    to be gained or lost. A different story exists, though, for strategies that have
    positions on for days, weeks, or months at a time. What is the best approach here?
    If the position is close to breakeven, just enter it manually. It may cost you
    or make you a few extra dollars, but in the long run it does not matter.'

    winners or big losers. What approach is best here? Some people will want to enter
    an open winning trade, on the theory that winning trades will keep on winning.
    That makes sense, except that you may be incurring much more risk to enter a winner.
    Let’s look at an example. Let’s say your trade is set up to yield either a $500
    profit or a $250 loss, and you never change the profit target or stop-loss. It
    is now midway through the trade, and you have a $300 open profit. Should you enter?
    Well, initially you had a 2:1 reward-to-risk ratio, and by entering mid-trade,
    you have a 200:550 or 0.36:1 reward-to-risk ratio. Although the likelihood of
    your getting a $200 gain before a $550 loss is much better than the original likelihood
    of $500 gain or $250 loss, I’d focus more on the downside. Instead of losing $250
    on the trade, you could lose $550\. Ask yourself whether you want to risk that
    extra loss.

    would be less by entering midtrade, and your potential gain could be a lot larger.
    This is the approach I use when starting to trade a new system: if the current
    open trade is a loser, I enter it. If it is a winning trade, I wait for the next
    signal, or until the position pull backs in profit to near breakeven. This is
    the approach that makes me comfortable. I am not emotional about it, I don’t worry
    if I made the right decision, I just consistently execute the plan. To me, that

    disappointment of waiting for a pullback in the equity curve, only to see the
    system go up for months on end. I’ve also entered open positions and suffered
    losses right off the bat, when waiting for the next entry signal would have been
    better. Similarly, sometimes the opposite occurred, and I “won” at these decisions.
    Overall, I don’t think it has improved my situation at all but has definitely
    led to lost emotional capital. So now I have a plan, known in advance, and I start

    The most common time for emotions to come into play is in the decision to take
    every trade or not. Clearly, if you’ve tested a strategy and concluded it is worthwhile,
    then you need to follow it exactly as tested. That sounds easy until a drawdown
    is incurred, or a number of consecutive losing trades occurs. That is when doubt
    and fear creep in. “The last five trades have been losers, and that only happened
    two times in the walk-forward back-test historical testing,” says the little voice
    in your head. “Skip this trade, and wait for a winner first.” Unfortunately, this
    is how the mind works, at least for me. It takes nerves of steel sometimes to
    overrule the voice in your head. But for any chance of long-term success, you
    need to keep taking signals without question. Otherwise, by picking and choosing
    which trades to take, and which to reject, you have completely invalidated all
    the testing and analysis behind the system. In other words, you are just gambling,
    and that almost never ends well.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once you get a good feel for your strategy, you’ll begin to know ahead of time
    when a signal is likely to be triggered. For example, at the close of each bar
    if you are expecting a buy on an upward moving average cross, if the current bar
    is trending higher, you’ll know the cross will occur at the close of the current
    bar. Greed can take hold here—why not enter now, before the bar closes? Extra
    profit might be yours, with no real additional risk. But just like “cherry picking”
    certain trades, this “jumping the gun” scenario is a really bad idea. There will
    be times where it doesn’t work out, and times it will. You can waste a lot of
    emotional capital stressing over whether to enter (or exit) early or not. Just
    remember, though, that when you don’t take the entries and exits exactly as your
    system says, you should not rely on historical results at all. What you’ve created
    is a new strategy, with no real historical basis.

    contrary to the strategy rules. So in both of these cases, the emotions can be
    eliminated by strict discipline—following the rules of the system without question,
    without fail. This discipline takes time to develop, especially if you are trading
    only one strategy. Your tendency will be to watch that strategy carefully, think
    about it often, and inevitably ponder overruling the strategy. My advice in this
    case is to trade multiple strategies if you can. Once you are trading three or
    more strategies, it becomes hard *not* to follow the rules. This is akin to the
    serial liar, who tells so many lies to so many people that eventually the truth
    comes out. You’ll get so confused by what you are actually doing and what you
    should be doing that just following the rules will be much, much easier.

    the position mismatch, your stress level goes through the roof. At least mine

    using multiple brokers leads to a less-than-optimal use of capital (margin) situation.

    they’ll have to “eat” the premium between the old and new months, or that they’ll
    pay multiple spreads to accomplish the roll. If you do it correctly, you don’t
    have to pay a premium, but you may have to pay two bid/ask spread costs instead
    of one, and you’ll have to pay the equivalent of one round turn commission. A
    lot of people are under the mistaken impression that they always lose or gain
    premium during a rollover. While this might be true for strategies such as scale
    trading, it does not have to be true for algorithmic systems with a simple rollover.
    I’ll explain all of that with a real-world example.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, it is worth explaining *why* a rollover is necessary. For intraday traders,
    where positions are closed at the end of each trading day, rollover should never
    be an issue. On the day of rollover, those traders simply start trading the new
    front contract month. For swing traders, however, the situation is a bit more
    complicated. Before first notice day or last trading day, whichever comes first,
    the trader must “roll” his position from the old contract month into the new contract
    month. For instance, if you are long September euros, you’ll want to sell the
    September euros, closing you out of that position, and buy the December euros.
    Not surprisingly, the devil is in the details, and an example is the best way
    to show the process.

    September contract, which is what was the lead contract at initial entry.

    at rollover, let’s say December was at 1.3303, while September was at 1.3299\.
    This is a difference of .0004, which is what the back-adjusted continuous contract
    needs to know. To adjust the continuous contract to have December as the front
    month, you simply have to add .0004 to each price point in the existing continuous
    contract. So we do this and now have a continuous contract, with December as the
    front month.

    the strategy will think you bought at 1.3276, with a stop-loss at 1.3226 and a
    profit target of 1.3376\. “But wait!” you say. “I didn’t buy at 1.3276\. I somehow
    got screwed!” Here’s the math, neglecting the bid/ask spread and the commission
    costs, just for this example.

    to the time in mid-September when you must roll over to the December contract.
    When you have to perform this rollover in an algorithmic strategy, how do you
    actually accomplish it? I usually do it one of three different ways. Each one
    has its advantages and disadvantages.

    strategies. It is also easy to screw up the order, and buy the spread instead
    of selling it. You have to be careful. Also, don’t think that just because you
    are trading the spread symbol, you’ll pay only one commission. Some people think
    this is true, and I guess those folks don’t read their statements very closely.
    When the brokerage does its accounting, it splits the spread into a separate buy

    spread. Astute readers have probably already thought about this method, and how
    it could save the spread on each side of the rollover. There is a reason I have
    not included it, and that is because it is a *terrible* thing to do. In theory,
    the approach saves you two spreads, but in reality one spread will be filled and
    the price will more often than not run away from your second limit order, leaving
    you with half a rollover (in other words, flat). Thus, the times this approach
    does work are completely overshadowed by times the approach does not work. In
    the end, it will cost you much more to try and save a few dollars in spread costs.
    Therefore, I recommend one of the three methods above, completing the rollover
    quickly, and then moving on to other trading endeavors.
  prefs: []

- en: That is how a rollover is actually accomplished. Whenever I can, I use the exchange-supported
    spreads to do my rollovers. I can do this with systems where I enter orders manually.
    For my fully automated systems, I generally use method 1, even though it is the
    most expensive. When I use method 2, I sometimes find myself chasing the market
    with my order, or worse yet, I forget about the rollover for a while, leaving
    me temporarily doubly exposed, until I fix it.
