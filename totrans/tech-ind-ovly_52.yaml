- en: Developed by William Blau and introduced in Stocks & Commodities Magazine, the
    True Strength Index (TSI) is a momentum oscillator based on a double smoothing
    of price changes. Even though several steps are needed for calculation, the indicator
    is actually pretty straightforward. By smoothing price changes, TSI captures the
    ebbs and flows of price action with a steadier line that filters out the noise.
    As with most momentum oscillators, chartists can derive signals from overbought/oversold
    readings, centerline crossovers, bullish/bearish divergences and signal line crossovers.

- en: 'The True Strength Index (TSI) can be divided into three parts: the double smoothed
    price change, the double smoothed absolute price change, and the TSI formula.
    First, calculate the price change from one period to the next. Second, calculate
    a 25-period EMA of this price change. Third, calculate a 13-period EMA of this
    25-period EMA to create a double smoothing. The same double smoothing technique
    is used for the absolute price change. After these initial calculations, divide
    the double smoothed price change by the absolute double smoothed price change
    and multiply by 100 to move the decimal two places.'

- en: The first part, which is the double smoothed price change, sets the positive
    or negative tone for TSI. The indicator is negative when the double smoothed price
    change is negative and positive when it is positive. The double smoothed absolute
    price change normalizes the indicator and limits the range of the ensuing oscillator.
    In other words, this indicator measures the double smoothed price change relative
    to the double smoothed absolute price change. A string of large positive price
    changes results in relatively high positive readings because this signals strong
    upside momentum. A string of large negative price changes pushes TSI deep into
    negative territory.

- en: The True Strength Index (TSI) is an oscillator that fluctuates between positive
    and negative territory. As with many momentum oscillators, the centerline defines
    the overall bias. The bulls have the momentum edge when TSI is positive and the
    bears have the edge when it's negative. As with MACD, a signal line can be applied
    to identify upturns and downturns. Signal line crossovers are, however, quite
    frequent and require further filtering with other techniques. Chartists can also
    look for bullish and bearish divergences to anticipate trend reversals; however,
    keep in mind that divergences can be misleading in a strong trend.
  prefs: []

- en: TSI is somewhat unique because it tracks the underlying price quite well. In
    other words, the oscillator can capture a sustained move in one direction or the
    other. The peaks and troughs in the oscillator often match the peaks and troughs
    in price. In this regard, chartists can draw trend lines and mark support/resistance
    levels using TSI. Line breaks can then be used to generate signals.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The centerline crossover is the purest signal. The double smoothed momentum
    of price changes is positive when TSI is above zero and negative when below zero.
    Prices are generally rising when TSI is positive and falling when TSI is negative.
    The example below shows Nike (NKE) turning bullish in September 2011 as TSI moved
    into positive territory (green line). The stock remained bullish as the uptrend
    extended into the spring of 2012\. Nike turned bearish when TSI turned negative
    and the stock broke support.

    breakouts or breakdowns. The example below shows Citigroup (C) with TSI establishing
    support in March. The indicator broke support in early April and this breakdown
    foreshadowed a significant decline into May. TSI then rebounded in June and formed
    a flat consolidation into July. This consolidation resembled a falling flag and
    TSI broke above the trend line in late July. This breakout preceded further strength
    into August.

- en: Overbought and oversold levels for the True Strength Index vary according to
    a security's volatility and the period settings for the indicator. The TSI range
    will be smaller for stocks with low volatility, such as utilities. The TSI range
    will be larger for stocks with high volatility, such as biotechs. Using shorter
    time periods for the smoothing will result in a wider range and choppier indicator
    line. Longer time periods will result in a smaller range and smoother line. It
    is the classic technical analysis tradeoff. Chartists get quicker signals and
    less lag with shorter periods, but this comes at the expense of more whipsaws
    and false signals. Longer periods reduce the whipsaws, but these signals come
    with more lag and a poorer reward-to-risk ratio.

- en: The chart above shows the Nasdaq 100 ETF (QQQ) with TSI using two different
    timeframes. The upper indicator window shows TSI (40,20,7) fluctuating between
    -20 and +44 with 20/-20 marking overbought/oversold. The lower window shows TSI
    (13,7,7) fluctuating between +78 and -69 with 50/-50 marking overbought/oversold.
    Notice how TSI in the lower window is much more volatile than TSI in the upper
    window. Also, notice that the more sensitive TSI produced two oversold readings
    and four overbought readings (blue arrows). Overbought and oversold are not signals
    of an impending reversal. They simply suggest that prices have come too far too
    fast. Chartists must wait for a confirming signal to suggest an actual reversal.
    The blue lines mark support and resistance using trend lines, peaks or troughs.
    Once an overbought or oversold reading occurs, chartists can use these lines to
    define a price reversal. This will not illuminate whipsaws, but it will reduce
    bad signals.

- en: The last parameter in the TSI setting is the signal line, which is simply an
    exponential moving average of TSI. Signal line crossovers are by far the most
    common signals. This means there will be good, bad and ugly signals. In an effort
    to reduce signals and noise, chartists should consider increasing the settings
    for TSI or the price chart settings. The example below shows TSI(40,20,10) using
    a weekly chart. This means the signal line is a 10-period EMA of TSI. There was
    no shortage of signals on this chart as TSI crossed the signal line at least 12
    times from April 2007 to July 2012\.

- en: The True Strength Index (TSI) is a unique indicator based on double smoothed
    price changes. Price change represents momentum in its truest form. The double
    smoothing with two exponential moving averages reduces the noise and produces
    an oscillator that tracks price quite well. In addition to the usual oscillator
    signals, chartists can often draw trend lines, support lines and resistance lines
    directly on TSI. These can then be used to generate signals based on breakouts
    and breakdowns. As with all indicators, TSI signals should be confirmed with other
    indicators and analysis techniques.

    Once selected, users can place the indicator above, below or behind the underlying
    price plot. Placing TSI directly behind the price plot accentuates the movements
    relative to the price action of the underlying security. Users can apply “advanced
    options” to add horizontal lines for setting overbought and oversold levels. Adjusting
    the numbers in the Parameters box will change the settings. [Click here](http://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=$COMPQ&p=D&yr=0&mn=6&dy=0&id=p28704616394&a=276577901
