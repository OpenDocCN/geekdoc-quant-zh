- en: The slope indicator measures the rise-over-run of a linear regression, which
    is the line of best fit for a price series. Fluctuating above and below zero,
    the Slope indicator best resembles a [momentum oscillator](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:introduction_to_technical_indicators_and_oscillators#momentum_oscillators
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:introduction_to_technical_indicators_and_oscillators")
    without boundaries. It is not well suited for overbought/oversold levels, but
    can measure the direction and strength of a trend. It can also be used with other
    indicators to identify potential entry points within an ongoing trend.

- en: Slope is based on a linear regression (line of best fit). Even though the formula
    for a linear regression is beyond the scope of this article, a linear regression
    can be shown using the Raff Regression Channel in SharpCharts. This indicator
    features a linear regression in the middle with equidistant outer trend lines.
    Slope equals the rise-over-run for the linear regression. Rise refers to the price
    change. Run refers to the timeframe. A 20-day Slope would be the rise-over-run
    of a 20-day linear regression. If the rise is 4 points and the run is two days,
    then the slope would be 2 (4/2 = 2). If the rise is -6 points and the run is 2,
    then the slope would be -3 (6/2 = 3). In general, an advancing period has a positive
    slope and a declining period has a negative slope. The steepness depends on the
    sharpness of the advance or decline.

    A 20-day [Raff Regression Channel](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:chart_analysis:raff_regression_chan
    "chart_school:chart_analysis:raff_regression_chan") is shown for each 20-day period.
    The linear regression, in the middle, represents the “line of best fit” for the
    20 data points. The dotted lines mark the end of the 20-day period and the value
    of the slope at that price point. The first period is relatively flat and the
    slope is barely positive. The second period is up and the slope is clearly positive.
    The third period is down and the slope is negative. Keep in mind that the Slope
    changes as old data points are dropped off and new data points are added.

- en: Slope can be used to quantify the [trend](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:chart_analysis:trend_lines
    "chart_school:chart_analysis:trend_lines"). A positive slope is by definition
    an uptrend. Similarly, a negative slope defines a downtrend. Chart 2 shows the
    Dow Industrials with a 52-week Slope (one year). The red dotted lines show the
    Slope turning negative, while the green dotted lines show the slope turning positive.
    The 52-week Slope was positive for around two years (2006-2007) and then turned
    negative in February 2008\. Even though the Dow bottomed in March 2009 and moved
    sharply higher, the 52-week Slope did not cross back into positive territory until
    September 2009\. Notice that the slope does not predict the trend. Instead, it
    follows the trend or the price points. This means there will be some lag.

- en: Directional movement can also be important when analyzing the slope. A negative
    and rising slope shows improvement within a downtrend. A positive and falling
    slope shows deterioration within an uptrend. Chart 3 shows the Nasdaq 100 ETF
    (QQQQ) with the 100-day Slope. A 20-day simple moving average was added to identify
    upturns and downturns. A Slope is rising when above its 20-day SMA and falling
    when below. Four key crossovers are identified on this chart (green/red arrows).
    Notice that the crossovers occurred before the Slope turned negative or positive.
    This is like a leading indication for the Slope. Also, notice the bounce after
    the negative cross in July 2008 and the retest after the positive cross in January
    2009\. These early slope reversals foreshadowed a move into positive territory
    or a trend change, but do not expect an extended move after every moving average
    crossover. The 100-day Slope moved below its 20-day SMA in August 2009, but QQQQ
    kept right on moving higher. A declining and positive Slope reflects less steepness
    in the advance. Notice how the 100-day Slope remained positive as QQQQ continued
    higher from September 2009 to January 2010\.

- en: Slope alone cannot be used to participate in an ongoing trend, but it can be
    used with other indicators to identify potential entry points. In particular,
    Slope can be used for trend identification to establish a trading bias. A positive
    slope dictates a bullish bias, while a negative Slope dictates a bearish bias.
    Once a trading bias is established, a momentum oscillator can be used to identify
    potential entry points. The choice of momentum oscillator is really a personal
    preference. The example with Apple uses the 100-day Slope with 10-day [Williams
    %R](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:williams_r "chart_school:technical_indicators:williams_r").
    The look-back period for the Slope should be significantly longer than the look-back
    period for the momentum oscillator. The Slope defines the bigger trend, while
    the momentum oscillator represents a subset of that trend. Chart 4 shows the 100-day
    Slope moving above zero in July to establish a bullish bias. Only bullish signals
    are considered for the momentum oscillator. These include oversold readings, centerline
    crossovers, or signal line crossovers. [Williams %R](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:williams_r
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:williams_r") does not have a signal line, but
    [MACD](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_average_convergence_divergence_macd
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_average_convergence_divergence_macd")
    and PPO do. The blue dotted lines show when 10-day Williams %R moves below -80%
    to become oversold. Notice that these readings correspond with short pullbacks
    in the stock. Except for the last oversold reading in early December, Apple resumed
    its uptrend soon after these oversold readings.

- en: The Slope of two (or more) securities can be compared to identify relative strength
    and relative weakness. The chart below shows Amazon (AMZN) with the S&P 500\.
    Both securities are shown with the 20-day Slope (black). The blue vertical line
    marks a point in early November when Amazon had a positive Slope and the S&P 500
    had a negative Slope. Amazon was clearly outperforming the S&P 500 at this time.
    In fact, when the S&P 500 bottomed in early November, Amazon led the way higher
    with a move from 117 to 143\. Notice that Amazon moved higher even as the Slope
    moved lower. The Amazon Slope turned negative in mid-December and the S&P 500
    Slope was still positive. This situation repeated the second week of January.
    Based on the Slope comparison, Amazon went from relative strength in November
    to relative weakness in December and January. During these two months, the 20-day
    linear regression for Amazon was sloping down while the 20-day linear regression
    for the S&P 500 was sloping up.

- en: Slope measures the rise-over-run of a linear regression. In general, an uptrend
    is present when Slope is positive and a downtrend exists when the slope is negative.
    The timeframe depends on the number of days. 10 days covers a short-term trend,
    100 days a medium-term trend, and 250 days a long-term trend. As with typical
    trend-following indicators, Slope lags price and reverses after an actual top
    or bottom. This does not, however, detract from its usefulness. Trend identification
    and trend strength are important tools, even for traders. As with moving averages,
    Slope can be used with momentum indicators to participate in an ongoing trend.
