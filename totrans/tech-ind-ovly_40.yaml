- en: The Price Relative indicator compares the performance of one security to another
    with a ratio chart. This indicator is also known as the Relative Strength indicator
    or sometimes the Relative Strength Comparative. Often, the Price Relative indicator
    is used to compare the performance of a stock against a benchmark index, such
    as the S&P 500\. Chartists can also use the Price Relative to compare the performance
    of a stock to its sector or industry group. This makes it possible to determine
    if a stock is leading or lagging its peers. The Price Relative indicator can also
    be used to find stocks that are holding up better during a broad market decline
    or showing weakness during a broad market advance.

    Price Relative indicator. A ratio symbol consists of two ticker symbols joined
    together with a colon character (e.g., “IBM:$SPX”, “$INDU:$GOLD”). The value of
    a ratio ticker symbol is equal to the close of the first symbol divided by the
    close of the second symbol.'

- en: The Price Relative indicator is simply the base security divided by the comparative
    security. Typically, the underlying security is a stock and the benchmark is the
    S&P 500\. For example, chartists can use the Price Relative to show the performance
    of Starbucks (SBUX) relative to the S&P 500 ($SPX). This would simply be the price
    of Starbucks divided by the S&P 500\. Starbucks is part of the consumer discretionary
    sector. Chartists could also view the performance of Starbucks relative to the
    Consumer Discretionary SPDR (XLY) with the appropriate [ratio symbol](http://stockcharts.com/docs/doku.php?id=data#ratio_symbols_relative_strength
    "http://stockcharts.com/docs/doku.php?id=data#ratio_symbols_relative_strength")
    (SBUX:XLY). Chartists could also view sector performance relative to the S&P 500
    (XLY:$SPX).

    in row two is .0256 (30.66/1197.75). This ratio increases when Starbucks advances
    more than the S&P 500 or declines less than the S&P 500\. This ratio decreases
    when Starbucks advances less than the S&P 500 or declines more than the S&P 500\.
    For reference, the table also shows the percentage change in Starbucks and the
    S&P 500\. The percentage change in Starbucks less the percentage change in the
    S&P 500 is also equal to the daily changes in the Price Relative. In row two,
    notice that Starbucks was down 2.66% and the S&P 500 was down 1.62%. The Price
    Relative moved lower (-1.04%) because Starbucks declined more than the S&P 500\.
    Row three shows the Price Relative rising because Starbucks (+.50%) was up more
    than the S&P 500 (+.02%). The chart below shows the Price Relative in action.

- en: The Price Relative is used to gauge relative strength, which is important when
    it comes to stock selection. Many portfolio managers compare their performance
    to a benchmark, such as the S&P 500\. Their goal is to outperform that benchmark.
    In order to achieve this goal, managers often look for stocks that are showing
    relative strength. Enter the Price Relative. The Price Relative rises when a stock
    shows relative strength and is outperforming its benchmark. Conversely, the Price
    Relative falls when a stock shows relative weakness and is underperforming its
    benchmark.

- en: There are a few ways to use the Price Relative. First, chartists can perform
    simple trend analysis to determine the direction of the Price Relative. This can
    be based on the actual trend, support/resistance breaks, moving averages or other
    indicators. Second, chartists can look for bullish and bearish divergences in
    relative strength to warn of a potential reversal in the stock price.

    "chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_averages") to determine the direction
    of the Price Relative. As with any price chart, the Price Relative is trending
    up when higher highs and higher lows form. Conversely, the Price Relative is trending
    down when lower lows and lower highs form. Chartists can also apply a moving average
    of choice. A long-term downtrend could be present when the Price Relative is trading
    below its 150-day SMA. Alternatively, a long-term uptrend could be present when
    the Price Relative is trading above its 150-day SMA.

    A 15-day SMA was applied to both the HPQ price and the Price Relative. First,
    notice that the Price Relative broke resistance in mid-June to signal the start
    of an uptrend. Outperformance continued into December as the Price Relative traced
    out higher highs and higher lows. The Price Relative peaked in late December and
    formed a lower high in late February. The subsequent break below the 150-day SMA
    signaled the start of a downtrend and a period of underperformance.

    a price decline. Stocks that hold up the best during a decline are often the leaders
    when the market turns around. The chart below shows Dupont (DD) with the Price
    Relative (DD:$SPX). Even though the stock declined from late April until early
    July, the Price Relative moved higher to signal relative strength during this
    decline. Dupont was holding up better than the overall market. The stock subsequently
    became a leader when the market reversed and started moving higher in July. Notice
    that the Price Relative and the stock both broke resistance in late July (blue
    lines).

    a price advance. Stocks that underperform on the way up often lead lower when
    the market reverses. The chart below shows Mastercard (MA) with the Price Relative
    (MA:$SPX). After a sharp decline in early February, the stock advanced to a new
    reaction high in late April. The Price Relative did not confirm and formed a significantly
    lower high for a bearish divergence. Also, notice that Price Relative was flat
    when the stock advanced from the second week of March until late April (blue lines).
    These signs of relative weakness on the way up foreshadowed a sharp decline in
    May.

    Price Relative can also be used for broad market analysis. The stock market can
    be broken down into nine sectors represented by the sector SPDRs. Chartists can
    maintain charts with Price Relatives for these nine sectors to determine the leaders
    and the laggards. The market is in offensive mode when the technology and consumer
    discretionary sectors lead. The market is in defensive mode when consumer staples,
    healthcare and utility sectors lead. Once the leading sectors have been determined,
    chartists can then look within these sectors to find the leading stocks. Sectors
    that show relative weakness can be avoided to help narrow the search. As with
    all indicators, it is important to use the Price Relative in conjunction with
    other technical analysis tools. [momentum oscillators](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:introduction_to_technical_indicators_and_oscillators#momentum_oscillators

    and [chart patterns](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:chart_analysis:chart_patterns

    relative strength or relative weakness.

    "http://stockcharts.com/docs/doku.php?id=data#ratio_symbols_relative_strength")
    (e.g., “IBM:$SPX”). First, select the “Price” indicator. Second, in the parameter
    box, enter the symbol for the base security followed by a colon (”:”) and then
    the symbol for the comparative security.

    and “$INDUSTRY”. We will automatically replace those symbols with the appropriate
    sector or industry ETF/index. For example “IBM:$SECTOR” is the same as “IBM:XLK”.

    base security. Placing the indicator “behind price” makes it easy to compare the
    two lines. The chart below shows the Price Relative (pink) behind the price plot.
    Notice the bullish divergence in August and the bearish divergence in December.
    Use “Advanced Options” to add a moving average or another indicator to the Price
    Relative. [Click here for a live example](http://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=XLY&p=D&yr=0&mn=6&dy=0&id=p08051994524&listNum=30&a=220460939
