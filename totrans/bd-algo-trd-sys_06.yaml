    and the dimensions closely checked. The idea is to ensure that the part-making
    process is going smoothly, and to give an early warning signal when things are
    beginning to go bad. The same process holds true in evaluating live trading systems.
    I use a variety of tools to monitor strategies I am trading or that I am incubating.

    [Figure 23.1](#figure23-1). It tells me, at a glance, how my strategy has performed
    historically and in real time. To keep consistency, I use the same data source
    for all the data. In my case, it is the Trade List provided by TradeStation. You
    can get similar data from just about every trading platform. *This is **not**
    actual real money data,* which will be covered in later charts and metrics.

    real-time performance (the portion of the curve on the right). Are the real-time
    data consistent with the historical test and the incubation period data? If not,
    there may be something amiss. Maybe the strategy has stopped working correctly,
    due to market conditions, for example. Or maybe the assumptions made in the strategy
    about limit order fills are not realistic. This could especially be true in scalping-type
    strategies, although really you may need actual real-money results to check that.

    with $10,000 on day 0\. On day 1, it hits a new equity high of $10,500\. The drawdown
    on day 1, since it is a new equity high, is $0\. On day 2, let’s say the equity
    falls to $9,700\. Now, the drawdown on day 2 is $10,500 - $9,700 = $800\. And
    so it goes through the rest of the days. On days where a new equity is reached,
    the drawdown will simply be $0\. On all other days, the drawdown will be the difference
    between that day’s equity and the maximum equity up until that point.

    trading data. Assume that we have a trading system that averages $100 per day,
    with a standard deviation of plus or minus $50\. With two standard deviation bands,
    we expect roughly 95 percent of the values to fall in between the upper and lower
    curves, or the 97.7 percentile on the upper end and 2.3 percentile on the lower
    end. If we then run Monte Carlo analysis on a trade-by-trade basis, for each trading
    day we simply select the values at the 2.3 and 97.7 percentiles. Since these values
    use the actual data, not an assumed normal distribution, they should be more accurate
    and representative of the actual trading system. The drawback is that the curves
    will not be smooth and could change if the simulation is rerun. Such are the penalties

    For the first few months of live trading, every four weeks or so, I review the
    current performance of the system as shown in [Figure 24.1](#figure24-1), and
    answer some standard questions. This information may be useful should the performance
    of the system become erratic—maybe there was something I could have seen earlier,
    or something I just plain out missed.

- en: After seven weeks of live trading, is the system performing as designed? First,
    let’s look at the number of trades it has taken. A sharp increase or decrease
    in the number of trades, when compared to the walk-forward history, would suggest
    that the market action is different than the historical market, causing many more,
    or far fewer, trades to be taken than normal. After seven weeks, the system has
    traded for 18 days, or 53 percent of possible days. Historically, it trades about
    151 days per year, or 60 percent of days. So the system is trading less than the
    average. But some years it has traded as few as 130 days (51 percent) and as many
    as 175 days (70 percent). Based on all this, I’d conclude that the number of trades
    is generally in line with expectations, although at the low end. Anecdotally,
    I have felt that the volatility has been lower than usual. There have been a handful
    of days where an entry was missed by only a few ticks (the big Fed move day, September
    18, was a case in point). A little more volatility in the hours before the announcement
    and the system would have entered a big winner.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Second, let’s look at average performance versus actual performance. The average
    historical performance of the system gives $1,441 profit after 18 trading days.
    Actual performance, however, is at -$746\. This is a *huge* discrepancy, and the
    conclusion obviously is that the system is not performing as well as it should.
    But here is where is gets tricky. Take a coin and flip it 100 times. If you get
    60 heads, do you conclude that the coin is “broken,” that is, biased? What if
    you got 70 heads, or 80, or 90? Even if you flipped 100 heads in a row, could
    you absolutely conclude that the coin is biased? No! There is a chance, albeit
    very, very small, that a fair coin could be flipped heads 100 consecutive times.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is the same way with a trading system. You can ask, “Is it broken?,” but
    the answer will always have some degree of uncertainty. That uncertainty sometimes
    makes all the difference to your conclusions and decisions. Some people take statistics
    as gospel, but I’ll relate a little secret I learned. Back in my previous career,
    I had a statistician who worked for me. I assigned a project to him that required
    a lot of data analysis and then some sort of conclusion. After he reviewed the
    details of the project, before he even started work, he asked me, “What conclusion
    would you like? I can make the data support your point of view, whatever it is.”
    I was astounded, but I never forgot the lesson—statistics can be manipulated very
    easily, so be careful making any conclusions based on them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Right now, the actual system performance is at the 10th percentile of what was
    expected. The 50th percentile would be right at the average, so the 10 percent
    mark is pretty bad. But it is still within the realm of possible outcomes. If
    it were below the 0 percentile—let’s say the system had lost $8,000 through the
    first 18 days—then the system obviously would not be performing as expected. That
    would be an easy decision. It is where there is uncertainty that things get tough.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are statistical tests that could be run to show whether the current trades
    could be part of the historical distribution of trades, but even such advanced
    analysis is not definitive. There is always a gray area. So how do I navigate
    the gray area? First, I try to determine the parameters that will cause me to
    quit trading a system. I could certainly use the percentile number approach and
    have a quitting rule that says, “If after X days the performance is below the
    Yth percentile, I will cease trading.” X and Y would be at my discretion, based
    on personal preferences. As long as I stick to the rule I create at the start,
    I’d be doing fine. For me, and for this particular system, earlier I decided that
    I would quit only when I hit a $5,000 drawdown. So I am not using the data in
    the tracking graph to decide when to quit. Sometimes I do use it, though.

    there are tons of disclaimers you have to sign when you open an account, and then
    if you want to automate a strategy, there are two more disclaimers you have to
    click and accept. The first disclaimer is 397 words, and the second is a whopping
    593 words. That is a lot of legalese to wade through just to automate your trading.

    be active for the current bar only. After the bar closes, any open orders get

    may be placed for the current bar.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, Monday night during week 9, my euro night strategy placed a limit order
    to buy, well below the market. It did not get filled during the bar, so it should
    have been canceled. For whatever reason, it was not canceled. This is the first
    time I have *ever* seen this occur. The success rate of the software auto-canceling
    orders, from my experience, has to be well over 99 percent. That is excellent,
    but errors can and do occur. Just look at the airline industry, for example. There
    are roughly 28,000 commercial flights per day, and if even 99.99 percent had successful
    takeoffs and landings, two or three planes would crash *per day*. That’s where
    claims of 99 percent plus uptime, accuracy, whatever are meaningless. Anything
    less than 100 percent perfection runs the risk of costing you money.

    had gone negative. Then, to add insult to injury, while I investigated the issue—before
    I exited the position—I watched it drop another $125 or so. Once I confirmed that
    the position was wrong, I exited with about a $550 loss.

    remember losses due to mistakes and keep them filed in my memory bank. Some of

    the time, price has to trade through your price to get you a fill at the limit
    price.

    limit orders are filled when touched, the results will be too optimistic. If the
    back-test engine assumes price must be penetrated to get a fill, then the back-test
    results will be a bit too pessimistic. I always go with the pessimistic approach.
    My actual results can then only be better than the back test.
  prefs: []

- en: During trading for week 9, the euro day strategy bought the exact low of the
    bar on a limit order. Of course, part of the reason I was filled was that I was
    trading a 1 lot; if I were trading a 10 lot, I probably would have received only
    a partial fill. The interesting thing is that when I refreshed the chart, the
    trade went away, according to the strategy engine. Since the price did not go
    one tick below my limit price, the strategy engine assumes there was no trade.
    But my real account says there was a trade because I was indeed filled. Since
    the trade was a winner, it was a nice surprise for once! So this is roughly a
    $400 trade in my real account’s favor, when compared to the back-test engine.
    This makes up for the order problem that cost me $500 in the previous week.

    finally doing better, as depicted in [Figures 24.6](#figure24-6) and [24.7](#figure24-7).
    By looking at the big picture, it is clear that the performance of the past few
    weeks is getting the live results closer to the historical back test. The system
    still has to improve performance, but things are certainly looking better. After
    15 weeks of trading this system live, I am up about 1 percent from the start for
    the strategy-calculated performance and about 9.0 percent for the actual performance.'

    with expectations, especially in the past few weeks. But the strategy as a whole
    is still underperforming. As stated earlier, this approach relies on a handful
    of big profit trades per year, and so far in live trading there have not been
    any.'

- en: '**Are fills and trades live comparable to TradeStation strategy report?** No,
    and that is still good! I am doing about $700 better live than the strategy predicts
    because of (1) less slippage than planned and (2) multiple trades where I was
    filled in real life but not in the back-test engine (limit price penetration issues).'

- en: After 15 weeks, I will keep on trading per the plan, but this system is still
    underperforming, compared to original expectations. That is one drawback to a
    trading approach that requires large, but infrequent, winning trades. It might
    be a long time before this system really shows its capability.
