- en: The Money Flow Index (MFI) is an oscillator that uses both price and volume
    to measure buying and selling pressure. Created by Gene Quong and Avrum Soudack,
    MFI is also known as volume-weighted [RSI](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:relative_strength_index_rsi
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:relative_strength_index_rsi"). MFI starts with
    the typical price for each period. Money flow is positive when the typical price
    rises (buying pressure) and negative when the typical price declines (selling
    pressure). A ratio of positive and negative money flow is then plugged into an
    RSI formula to create an oscillator that moves between zero and one hundred. As
    a momentum oscillator tied to volume, the Money Flow Index (MFI) is best suited
    to identify reversals and price extremes with a variety of signals.

    SharpCharts and the setting recommended by the creators.

    is volume multiplied by the typical price. Raw Money Flow is positive when the
    typical price advances from one period to the next and negative when the typical
    price declines. The Raw Money Flow values are not used when the typical price
    is unchanged. The Money Flow Ratio in step 3 forms the basis for the Money Flow
    Index (MFI). Positive and Negative Money Flow are summed for the look-back period
    (14) and the Positive Money Flow sum is divided by the Negative Money Flow sum
    to create the ratio. The RSI formula is then applied to create a volume-weighted
    indicator. The table below shows a calculation example taken from an excel spreadsheet.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As a volume-weighted version of RSI, the Money Flow Index (MFI) can be interpreted
    similarly to RSI. The big difference is, of course, volume. Because volume is
    added to the mix, the Money Flow Index will act a little differently than RSI.
    Theories suggest that volume leads prices. RSI is a momentum oscillator that already
    leads prices. Incorporating volume can increase this lead time.

- en: Quong and Soudack identified three basic signals using the Money Flow Index.
    First, chartists can look for overbought or oversold levels to warn of unsustainable
    price extremes. Second, bullish and bearish divergence can be used to anticipate
    trend reversals. Third, failure swings at 80 or 20 can also be used to identify
    potential price reversals. For this article, the divergences and failure swings
    are be combined to create one signal group and increase robustness.

    and oversold levels can be used to identify unsustainable price extremes. Typically,
    MFI above 80 is considered overbought and MFI below 20 is considered oversold.
    Strong trends can present a problem for these classic overbought and oversold
    levels. MFI can become overbought (>80) and prices can simply continue higher
    when the uptrend is strong. Conversely, MFI can become oversold (<20) and prices
    can simply continue lower when the downtrend is strong. Quong and Soudack recommended
    expanding these extremes to further qualify signals. A move above 90 is truly
    overbought and a move below 10 is truly oversold. Moves above 90 and below 10
    are rare occurrences that suggest a price move is unsustainable. Admittedly, many
    stocks will trade for a long time without reaching the 90/10 extremes. However,
    chartists can use the StockCharts.com scan engine to find those that do. Links
    to such scans are provided at the end of this article.'

- en: JB Hunt (JBHT) became oversold when the Money Flow Index moved below 10 in late
    October 2009 and early February 2010\. The preceding declines were sharp enough
    to produce these readings, but the oversold extremes suggested that these declines
    were unsustainable. Oversold levels alone are not reason enough to turn bullish.
    Some sort of reversal or upturn is needed to confirm that prices have indeed turned
    a corner. JBHT confirmed the first oversold reading with a gap and trend line
    break on good volume. The stock confirmed the second oversold reading with a resistance
    breakout on good volume.

    in late September and late December 2009\. Extremes in MFI suggested that these
    advances were unsustainable and a pullback was imminent. The first overbought
    reading led to a sizable decline, but the second did not. Notice that ARO peaked
    with the first overbought reading and formed lower highs into October. The late
    October support break signaled a clear trend reversal. After the December overbought
    reading, ARO moved above 23 and consolidated. There were two down gaps and a support
    break, but these did not hold. Price action was stronger than the overbought reading.
    ARO ultimately broke resistance at 24 and surged back above 28\. The second signal
    did not work.

    A bullish failure swing occurs when MFI becomes oversold below 20, surges above
    20, holds above 20 on a pullback and then breaks above its prior reaction high.
    A bullish divergence forms when prices move to a lower low, but the indicator
    forms a higher low to show improving money flow or momentum.

    in January-February 2010\. First, notice how the stock formed a lower low in February
    and MFI held well above its January low for a bullish divergence. Second, notice
    how MFI dipped below 20 in January, held above 20 in February and broke its prior
    high in late February. This signal combination foreshadowed a strong advance in
    March.

- en: The Money Flow Index is a rather unique indicator that combines momentum and
    volume with an RSI formula. RSI momentum generally favors the bulls when the indicator
    is above 50 and the bears when below 50\. Even though MFI is considered a volume-weighted
    RSI, using the centerline to determine a bullish or bearish bias does not work
    as well. Instead, MFI is better suited to identify potential reversals with overbought/oversold
    levels, bullish/bearish divergences, and bullish/bearish failure swings. As with
    all indicators, MFI should not be used by itself. A pure [momentum oscillator](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:introduction_to_technical_indicators_and_oscillators#momentum_oscillators
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:introduction_to_technical_indicators_and_oscillators"),
    such as RSI, or [pattern analysis](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:chart_analysis:chart_patterns
    "chart_school:chart_analysis:chart_patterns") can be combined with MFI to increase
    signal robustness.

    above, below or behind the price plot of the underlying security. Placing MFI
    directly behind the price makes it easy to compare indicator swings with price
    movements. The default setting is 14-periods, but this can be adjusted to suit
    analysis needs. A shorter timeframe makes the indicator more sensitive. A longer
    timeframe makes it less sensitive. Users can click the green arrow next to “Advanced
    Options” to add horizontal lines for custom overbought and oversold levels. Two
