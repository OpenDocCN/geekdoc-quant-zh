- en: The Ichimoku Cloud, also known as Ichimoku Kinko Hyo, is a versatile indicator
    that defines support and resistance, identifies trend direction, gauges momentum
    and provides trading signals. Ichimoku Kinko Hyo translates into “one look equilibrium
    chart”. With one look, chartists can identify the trend and look for potential
    signals within that trend. The indicator was developed by Goichi Hosoda, a journalist,
    and published in his 1969 book. Even though the Ichimoku Cloud may seem complicated
    when viewed on the price chart, it is really a straightforward indicator that
    is very usable. It was, after all, created by a journalist, not a rocket scientist!
    Moreover, the concepts are easy to understand and the signals are well-defined.

    the high and low over a given period of time. For example, the first plot is simply
    an average of the 9-day high and 9-day low. Before computers were widely available,
    it would have been easier to calculate this high-low average rather than a 9-day
    [moving average](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_averages

    The chart below shows the Dow Industrials with the Ichimoku Cloud plots. The Conversion
    Line (blue) is the fastest and most sensitive line. Notice that it follows price
    action the closest. The Base Line (red) trails the faster Conversion Line, but
    follows price action pretty well. The relationship between the Conversion Line
    and Base Line is similar to the relationship between a 9-day moving average and
    26-day moving average. The 9-day is faster and more closely follows the price
    plot. The 26-day is slower and lags behind the 9-day. Incidentally, notice that
    9 and 26 are the same periods used to calculate [MACD](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_average_convergence_divergence_macd

- en: The Cloud (Kumo) is the most prominent feature of the Ichimoku Cloud plots.
    The Leading Span A (green) and Leading Span B (red) form the Cloud. The Leading
    Span A is the average of the Conversion Line and the Base Line. Because the Conversion
    Line and Base Line are calculated with 9 and 26 periods, respectively, the green
    Cloud boundary moves faster than the red Cloud boundary, which is the average
    of the 52-day high and the 52-day low. It is the same principle with moving averages.
    Shorter moving averages are more sensitive and faster than longer moving averages.

    trend is up when prices are above the Cloud, down when prices are below the Cloud
    and flat when prices are in the Cloud.** Second, the uptrend is strengthened when
    the Leading Span A (green cloud line) is rising and above the Leading Span B (red
    cloud line). This situation produces a ***green Cloud***. Conversely, a downtrend
    is reinforced when the Leading Span A (green cloud line) is falling and below
    the Leading Span B (red cloud line). This situation produces a ***red Cloud***.
    Because the Cloud is shifted forward 26 days, it also provides a glimpse of future
    support or resistance.

    IBM was in an uptrend from June to January as it traded above the Cloud. Second,
    notice how the Cloud offered support in July, early October, and early November.
    Third, notice how the Cloud provides a glimpse of future [resistance](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:chart_analysis:support_and_resistance
    "chart_school:chart_analysis:support_and_resistance"). **Remember, the entire
    Cloud is shifted forward 26 days.** This means it is plotted 26 days ahead of
    the last price point to indicate future support or resistance.

    changed when Boeing broke below Cloud support in June. The Cloud changed from
    green to red when the Leading Span A (green) moved below the Leading Span B (red)
    in July. The cloud break represented the first trend change signal, while the
    color change represented the second trend change signal. Notice how the Cloud
    then acted as resistance in August and January.

    more frequent, signals. It is important to remember that bullish signals are reinforced
    when prices are above the cloud and the cloud is green. Bearish signals are reinforced
    when prices are below the cloud and the cloud is red. In other words, bullish
    signals are preferred when the bigger trend is up (prices above green cloud),
    while bearish signals are preferred when the bigger trend is down (prices are
    below red cloud). This is the essence of trading in the direction of the bigger
    trend. Signals that are counter to the existing trend are deemed weaker. Short-term
    bullish signals within a long-term downtrend and short-term bearish signals within
    a long-term uptrend are less robust.

    First, the trend was up because the stock was trading above the Cloud and the
    Cloud was green. The Conversion Line dipped below the Base Line for a few days
    in late June to enable the setup. A bullish crossover signal was triggered when
    the Conversion Line moved back above the Base Line in July. The second signal
    occurred as the stock moved towards Cloud [support](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:chart_analysis:support_and_resistance
    "chart_school:chart_analysis:support_and_resistance"). The Conversion Line moved
    below the Base Line in September to enable the setup. Another bullish crossover
    signal was triggered when the Conversion Line moved back above the Base Line in
    October. Sometimes it is hard to determine exact Conversion Line and Base Line
    levels on the price chart. For reference, these numbers are displayed in the upper
    left-hand corner of each Sharpchart. As of the January 8 close, the Conversion
    Line was 62.62 (blue) and the Base Line was 63.71 (red).

    Ichimoku Cloud plots. The trend-following signals focus on the Cloud, while the
    momentum signals focus on the Turning and Base Lines. In general, movements above
    or below the cloud define the overall trend. Within that trend, the Cloud changes
    color as the trend ebbs and flows. Once the trend is identified, the Conversion
    Line and Base Line act similar to MACD for signal generation. And finally, simple
    price movements above or below the Base Line can be used to generate signals.

    Chartists can first determine the trend by using the Cloud. Once the trend is
    established, appropriate signals can be determined using the price plot, Conversion
    Line, and Base Line. The classic signal is to look for the Conversion Line to
    cross the Base Line. While this signal can be effective, it can also be rare in
    a strong trend. More signals can be found by looking for price to cross the Base
    Line (or even the Conversion Line).

    the Cloud offering support in an uptrend, traders should also be on alert for
    bullish signals when prices approach the Cloud on a pullback or consolidation.
    Conversely, in a bigger downtrend, traders should be on alert for bearish signals
    when prices approach the Cloud on an oversold bounce or consolidation.

    can identify the trend using the Cloud and then use classic momentum oscillators
    to identify overbought or oversold conditions. [Click here](http://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=IWM&p=D&yr=0&mn=6&dy=0&id=p03667051915&listNum=30&a=193876371

- en: The Ichimoku Cloud indicator is available on SharpCharts by selecting it as
    an indicator in the “Overlay” drop-down box. Default settings are 9 for the Conversion
    Line, 26 for the Base Line and 52 for the Leading Span B. The Leading Span A is
    based on the Conversion Line and Base Line. The number for the Base Line (26)
    is also used to move the Cloud forward (26 days). These numbers can be adjusted
    to suit individual trading and investing styles. Sometimes it is necessary to
    add extra bars to the chart when increasing the Base Line, which also increases
    the forward movement of the Cloud.
