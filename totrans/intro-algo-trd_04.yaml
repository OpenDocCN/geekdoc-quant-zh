    person – I won’t even call him a trader, since I highly doubt he even actively
    traded – was a so called expert on trendline trading.

- en: Trendline trading, for those of you unfamiliar with the term, is a method where
    you draw lines on price charts to capture the major trends.  Special significance
    is given to times where the price touches a trendline and bounces off it, and
    also to times where the price touches the trendline and then keeps on going through
    it.  In the first instance, the trendline is supposedly “respected” and in the
    second case, the trendline is “rejected.”  Both are purportedly meaningful.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is not the time or place to talk about the validity of such an approach
    – maybe randomly drawn lines would also sometimes show significance – but the
    point it is a trading method out there the many people use.  Most people using
    trendlines are likely discretionary traders, where the trendline is just one of
    the factors (including trader judgment) that influence trade signals.  They have
    rules, but sometimes the rules are fuzzy – not suitable for algo trading.

    A few bars before the alleged entry, a proper trendline would have looked like
    the line in red, not the line in blue.  There was no way to draw the blue upper
    trendline until AFTER the entry occurred.  How are you supposed to trade that
    way? (Answer: you can’t!)'

    a closer look at the entry.  Note how the price does not even touch the trendline

    have to be to the trendline to count as an entry?

    lost money?  Of course not.  So magazine article authors will do everything they

    to do with your algos.  You create an algo, program it in your trading platform
    (you could also program and test by hand, but it is laborious), and then test
    it on historical data (backtest it).  If it is profitable, you consider trading
    it.  If it is not profitable, you simple discard the strategy, and create another,
    different, strategy.

    to work in the future.  Note I said “more likely.”  It is far from a guarantee
    of future performance.  It could be that the market could change somehow, or that
    you made mistakes during the historical test, and that the future performance
    of the strategy might be terrible.

    that you have verified has performed well in the past, compared to the other options? 
    That is a major advantage to algo trading – the ability to test.  Knowing a strategy
    was properly tested with profitable results gives you a lot of confidence when
    you start live trading.  None of the options A-C above can give you that type
    of assurance.
