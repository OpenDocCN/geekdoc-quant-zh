- en: Developed by Thomas Aspray in 1986, the MACD-Histogram measures the distance
    between MACD and its signal line (the 9-day EMA of MACD). Like MACD, the MACD-Histogram
    is also an oscillator that fluctuates above and below the zero line. Aspray developed
    the MACD-Histogram to anticipate signal line crossovers in MACD. Because MACD
    uses moving averages and moving averages lag price, signal line crossovers can
    come late and affect the reward-to-risk ratio of a trade. Bullish or bearish divergences
    in the MACD-Histogram can alert chartists to an imminent signal line crossover
    in MACD. See our [ChartSchool article](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_average_convergence_divergence_macd
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_average_convergence_divergence_macd")
    for more on MACD.

    "chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_averages") (EMA) less the 26-day EMA.
    Closing prices are used to form the moving averages so MACD. A 9-day EMA of MACD
    is plotted along side to act as a signal line to identify turns in the indicator.
    The MACD-Histogram represents the difference between MACD and its 9-day EMA, the
    signal line. The histogram is positive when MACD is above its 9-day EMA and negative
    when MACD is below its 9-day EMA.

    indicator of an indicator. This means that the MACD-Histogram is four steps removed
    from the price of the underlying security. In other words, it is the fourth derivative
    of price.

    get from the actual price to the MACD-Histogram. Talk about massaging the data.
    While not necessarily a bad thing, chartists should keep this in mind when analyzing
    the MACD-Histogram. It is an indicator of an indicator. Therefore, it is designed
    to anticipate signals in MACD, which in turn is designed to identify changes in
    the price [momentum](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:rate_of_change_roc_and_momentum
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:rate_of_change_roc_and_momentum") of the underlying
    security.

    and crossovers. The MACD-Histogram, however, is measuring the distance between
    MACD and its signal line. The histogram is positive when MACD is above its signal
    line. Positive values increase as MACD diverges further from its signal line (to
    the upside). Positive values decrease as MACD and its signal line converge. The
    MACD-Histogram crosses the zero line as MACD crosses below its signal line. The
    indicator is negative when MACD is below its signal line. Negative values increase
    as MACD diverges further from its signal line (to the downside). Conversely, negative
    values decrease as MACD converges on its signal line.

    signal line crossover occurred in late September and this turned the MACD-Histogram
    negative. A bullish signal line crossover occurred in early December and this
    turned the MACD-Histogram positive the rest of the month. There was a period of
    divergence as MACD moved further from its signal line (green line) and a period
    of convergence as MACD moved closer to its signal line (red line).

    and [bearish divergences](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:glossary_b#bearish_divergence

    its signal line and could be ripe for a cross. There are two types of divergences:
    peak-trough and slant. A peak-trough divergence forms with two peaks or two troughs
    in the MACD-Histogram. A peak-trough bullish divergence forms when MACD forges
    a lower low and the MACD-Histogram forges a higher low. Well-defined troughs are
    important to the robustness of a peak-trough divergence. Chart 2 shows Caterpillar
    with a bullish divergence in the MACD-Histogram. Notice that MACD moved to a lower
    low in June-July, but the MACD-Histogram formed a higher low (trough). There are
    two distinct troughs. This bullish divergence foreshadowed the bullish signal
    line crossover in mid-July and a big rally.'

    Instead of two reaction highs, there is simply a slant lower as the MACD-Histogram
    moves towards the zero line. This slant towards the zero line reflects a convergence
    between MACD and its signal line. In other words, they are getting closer to each
    other. Momentum shows strength when MACD is moving away from its signal line and
    the MACD-Histogram expands. Momentum weakens as MACD moves closer to its signal
    line and the MACD-Histogram contracts. Contracting MACD-Histogram is the first
    step towards a signal line crossover.

    MACD moved sharply lower after the bearish signal line crossover in June 2009\.
    MACD moved to a new low in mid-July, but the MACD-Histogram held well above its
    prior low. In fact, the MACD-Histogram bottomed towards the end of June and formed
    a bullish slant divergence. The thick red lines show the distance between MACD
    and its signal line. It is sometimes hard to gauge distance on the chart so these
    lines highlight the difference between 26-June and 8-July. This slant divergence
    foreshadowed the bullish signal line crossover in mid-July and a sharp advance
    in the stock.

    indicator moved below its signal line to foreshadow a sharp decline in the stock.
    This chart also shows a nice bullish divergence in March-April.

- en: The MACD-Histogram is an indicator designed to predict signal line crossovers
    in MACD. By extension, it is designed as an early warning system for these signal
    line crossovers, which are the most frequent of MACD signals. Divergences in the
    MACD-Histogram can be used to filter signal line crossovers, which will reduce
    the number of signals. Even with a filter, the robustness of MACD-Histogram divergences
    is still an issue. Short and shallow divergences are much more frequent than long
    and large divergences. In other words, divergences that develop over a few days
    with shallow movements are generally less robust than divergences that develop
    over a few weeks with more pronounced movements. The signal line crossover provides
    the ultimate confirmation, but aggressive traders may try to improve the reward-to-risk
    ratio by making their move just before the crossover. This is when the MACD-Histogram
    is as close to the zero line as it can be without actually making a cross, usually
    between -.20 and +.20\.

- en: MACD comes with the MACD-Histogram, but the MACD-Histogram can be shown as a
    stand-alone indicator. This makes it much easier to identify divergences and crossovers.
    The MACD-Histogram can be set as an indicator above, below or behind the price
    plot of the underlying security. The histogram covers a lot of chart space so
    it is often best to place it above or below the main window. It is possible to
    show MACD without the histogram in the main window. Choose MACD as an indicator
    and change the signal line number from 9 to 1 (9,26,1). This will remove the signal
    line and the histogram. The signal line can be added separately by clicking the
    advanced indicator options and adding a 9-day EMA.
