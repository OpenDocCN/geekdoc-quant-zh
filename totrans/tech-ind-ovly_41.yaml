- en: Developed by Martin Pring, Know Sure Thing (KST) is a momentum oscillator based
    on the smoothed rate-of-change for four different timeframes. Pring referred to
    this indicator as the “Summed Rate of Change (KST)” in a 1992 article in *Stocks
    & Commodities* magazine. In short, KST measures price momentum for four different
    price cycles. It can be used just like any momentum oscillator. Chartists can
    look for divergences, overbought/oversold readings, signal line crossovers and
    centerline crossovers. Pring frequently applied trend lines to KST. Although trend
    line signals do not occur often, Pring notes that such breaks reinforce signal
    line crossovers.

    indicator. It is simply a weighted average of four different rate-of-change values
    that have been smoothed. For example, calculate the 10-period rate-of-change and
    then smooth it with a 10-period simple [moving average](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_averages
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_averages"). The chart below shows the
    four different rate-of-change indicators with the appropriate moving averages
    for smoothing.

    settings. These combinations are then weighted and summed. The shortest timeframe
    carries the least weight (1) and the longest timeframe carries the most weight
    (4). A 9-period simple moving average is added as a signal line.

    the bulls when KST is positive and the bears when KST is negative. A positive
    reading means the weighted and smoothed [rate-of-change](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:rate_of_change_roc_and_momentum
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:rate_of_change_roc_and_momentum") values are
    mostly positive and prices are moving higher. A negative reading indicates that
    prices are moving lower.

- en: After basic centerline crossovers, chartists can look for signal line crossovers
    and gauge general direction. KST is generally rising when above its signal line
    and falling when below its signal line. A rising and negative KST line indicates
    that downside momentum is waning. Conversely, a falling and positive KST line
    indicates that upside momentum is waning.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Even though there are many different signals possible with KST, the basic centerline
    and signal line crossovers are usually the most robust. Unlike RSI and the Stochastic
    Oscillator, KST does not have upper or lower limits. This makes it relatively
    ill-suited for overbought and oversold signals.

- en: Bullish and [bearish divergences](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:glossary_b#bearish_divergence
    "chart_school:glossary_b") are also possible for signals, but chartists need to
    be selective when using these. Most divergences in the basic rate-of-change indicator
    do not result in price reversals. Similarly, divergences in MACD and RSI are also
    prone to failure. It is probably best to use divergences when there is a large
    and blatant divergence. The example below shows BroadCom (BRCM) with a large bearish
    divergence and a large bullish divergence. These divergences were finalized with
    subsequent signal line crossovers (red and green arrows).

- en: Chartists should be careful with bearish signal line crossovers in strong uptrends
    and bullish signal line crossovers in strong downtrends. KST can move into positive
    territory and remain in positive territory for an extended period during a strong
    uptrend. The indicator will reach a relatively high level and then turn down,
    but never move into negative territory. This simply signals that upside momentum
    is slowing. Upside momentum is still stronger than downside momentum, but upside
    momentum is not a strong as in previous periods. The example below shows Sherwin
    Williams (SHW) with a strong uptrend from November 2011 to August 2012\. Even
    though KST fluctuated up and down, it never broke below zero and remained in positive
    territory the entire time. The bearish signal line crossovers simply indicated
    a slowing in upside momentum, not a trend change.

    long-term timeframe. Instead of just shifting between daily, weekly and monthly
    charts, Pring suggested changing the settings to suit each timeframe. KST is even
    smoother when using the weekly and monthly settings. This means chartists should
    use signal line crossovers to detect directional changes in price. The lag for
    centerline crossovers is often too great. The table below shows the rate-of-change
    settings and moving average settings for the short-term, medium-term and long-term
    studies.

    such thing. KST does, however, have its uses and Pring encourages chartists to
    try different settings because one size does not fit all. Utility and consumer
    staples are less volatile and may require more sensitive settings. Technology
    stocks are more volatile and may require less sensitive settings.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Chartists can also mix and match the rate-of-change settings and the moving
    average settings. The chart below shows the default KST in the first indicator
    window and a KST weighted in favor of the short-term rate-of-change in the second
    window. Instead of KST(10,15,20,30,10,10,10,15,9) the second window shows KST(30,20,15,10,10,10,10,10,9).
    The first rate-of-change setting carries the least weight and the fourth one carries
    the most weight. Note that the first four numbers represent the rate-of-change
    settings. The second four numbers represent the moving averages to smooth these
    four rate-of-change indicators. The final number is the signal line.

- en: Know Sure Thing (KST) is a momentum oscillator based on the smoothed rate-of-change
    over four different time periods. In this regard, it is designed to capture four
    different price cycles. KST can be used like other unbound momentum oscillators,
    such as MACD, the Percent Price Oscillator, and TRIX. In fact, KST closely resembles
    [TRIX](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:trix "chart_school:technical_indicators:trix").
    Because it is unbound, KST is not well suited for identifying overbought and oversold
    conditions. Martin Pring, the creator, favored signal line crossovers and trend
    line breaks for signals. As with all indicators, KST should be used in combination
    with other analysis techniques.

    the indicator above, below or behind the underlying price plot. Placing KST directly
    behind the price plot accentuates the movements relative to the price action of
    the underlying security. Users can apply “advanced options” to add a horizontal
    line. Adjusting the numbers in the parameters box will change the settings.
