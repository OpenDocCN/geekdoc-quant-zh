    an underlying asset. These underlying assets could be a variety of entities ranging
    from stocks, bonds, commodities to currencies, interest rates, or indices. Primarily,
    these instruments are utilized for hedging risks, speculating on future prices,
    and getting access to additional assets or leverage.

    how an option's value or price is determined. Fundamentally, an option's price
    is influenced by a multitude of factors such as the market price of the underlying
    asset, the option's strike price, the time left to expiration, the rate of return
    without risk (commonly a risk-free interest rate), and market volatility. The
    amalgamation of these variables into robust mathematical models generate theoretical
    prices for options, providing traders with essential inputs for their strategies.

    in 1973, is the cornerstone of modern financial theory. It is used to calculate
    a theoretical call and put price using the five key determinants mentioned above.
    The model assumes that financial markets are efficient, returns are normally distributed
    and that the risk-free rate and volatility of the underlying are known and constant.
    Notwithstanding these assumptions can be limiting in real-world scenarios, the
    model has been widely used due to its simplicity and speed in computation.

    to value American options that can be exercised at any time before expiration.
    The model is termed 'binomial' because it assumes that the underlying asset can
    only have two possible prices in the next time period - an up price and a down
    price.

    sensitivity of the option's price to movements in the underlying asset's value.
    For example, if an option has a delta of 0.6, this means the option's price will
    rise by $0.60 for each $1.00 rise in the underlying asset's price.

    or the requirement for all market participants to engage in fair, honest, and
    responsible trading. Regulatory bodies like the Financial Industry Regulatory
    Authority (FINRA) in the U.S., the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the UK,
    or the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) in Australia enforce
    rules targeting market manipulation, including deceptive trading practices and
    illegal dissemination of false or misleading market information.
