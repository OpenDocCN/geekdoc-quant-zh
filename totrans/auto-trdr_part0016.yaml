    (AI) that provides systems with the ability to automatically learn and improve
    from their experiences without being explicitly programmed to do so. It resembles
    the human mind's aptitude to learn from its surroundings and experiences.

    both for its predictive capabilities and its potential to uncover relationships
    within traditionally non-related factors influencing market shifts. Whether used
    in long-term investment strategies or in high-frequency trading where transactions
    are executed in milliseconds, ML is transforming the way traders strategize, execute,
    and manage trades.

    ML to trading. This mass of data includes everything from historical prices, trading
    volumes to even news articles, and social media posts. Machine Learning algorithms
    can analyze this vast amount of information, find patterns, and then predict future
    price movements with a higher degree of accuracy than traditional statistical
    methods.

    realm of Supervised Learning strategies, we will encounter a dynamic interplay
    between robust algorithms and the financial cosmos, which, if harnessed correctly,
    can lead to extraordinary insights and gains.

    in the realm of algorithms. The 'student' here is the algorithm we are training,
    and the 'teacher' represents the labeled data that guides the algorithm. Our aim
    is to allow the algorithm, or the machine, to learn a mapping function from inputs
    (features) to outputs (labels). The more accurately the machine can map this function,
    the more faithfully it can predict future outcomes based on given inputs.

    instance, predicting the closing stock price of a company the next day. Linear

    referred to as the 'input layer', receives raw, unprocessed data. Here, each neuron
    represents a different data feature or input. Following this is a series of 'hidden
    layers', where the actual calculations take place. Raw data is weighed, biased,
    squeezed into activation functions, before moving onto the next layer—a meticulous
    process of generating and propagating scores. Arising from this operation, we
    arrive at the 'output layer', which provides the consequential predictions or
    classifications.

    a pitfall that has stumbled even the most refined algorithmic traders in their
    pursuit of perfectly fine-tuned machine learning models. Overfitting, in layman
    terms, is analogous to a key tailored so specifically to a lock that it ceases
    to work when the lock's intricate internals change ever so slightly. In the realm
    of trading, where the market is akin to a lock changing continually, an overfitted
    model loses its edge, becoming more of a liability than an asset.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    complex or 'too clever'. It arises when our model learns the intricate noise in
    the training data to the extent that it negatively impacts the performance of
    the model on new, unseen data. In simple words, it memorizes the training data
    rather than learning to generalize from a pattern. The model performs very well
    on train data but fails miserably on unseen or test data.
