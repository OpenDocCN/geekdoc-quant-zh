- en: Moving averages smooth the price data to form a trend following indicator. They
    do not predict price direction, but rather define the current direction with a
    lag. Moving averages lag because they are based on past prices. Despite this lag,
    moving averages help smooth price action and filter out the noise. They also form
    the building blocks for many other technical indicators and overlays, such as
    [Bollinger Bands](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:bollinger_bands
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:bollinger_bands"), [MACD](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_average_convergence_divergence_macd
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_average_convergence_divergence_macd")
    and [the McClellan Oscillator](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:market_indicators:mcclellan_oscillator
    "chart_school:market_indicators:mcclellan_oscillator"). The two most popular types
    of moving averages are the **Simple Moving Average (SMA)** and the **Exponential
    Moving Average (EMA)**. These moving averages can be used to identify the direction
    of the trend or define potential support and resistance levels.

    over a specific number of periods.** Most moving averages are based on closing
    prices. A 5-day simple moving average is the five-day sum of closing prices divided
    by five. As its name implies, a moving average is an average that moves. Old data
    is dropped as new data comes available. This causes the average to move along
    the time scale. Below is an example of a 5-day moving average evolving over three
    days.'

    day of the moving average drops the first data point (11) and adds the new data
    point (16). The third day of the moving average continues by dropping the first
    data point (12) and adding the new data point (17). In the example above, prices
    gradually increase from 11 to 17 over a total of seven days. Notice that the moving
    average also rises from 13 to 15 over a three-day calculation period. Also, notice
    that each moving average value is just below the last price. For example, the
    moving average for day one equals 13 and the last price is 15\. Prices the prior
    four days were lower and this causes the moving average to lag.

    recent prices. The weighting applied to the most recent price depends on the number
    of periods in the moving average. EMAs differ from simple moving averages in that
    a given day's EMA calculation depends on the EMA calculations for all the days
    prior to that day. You need far more than 10 days of data to calculate a reasonably
    accurate 10-day EMA.

    calculate the simple moving average for the initial EMA value. An exponential
    moving average (EMA) has to start somewhere, so a simple moving average is used
    as the previous period's EMA in the first calculation. Second, calculate the weighting
    multiplier. Third, calculate the exponential moving average for each day between
    the initial EMA value and today, using the price, the multiplier, and the previous
    period's EMA value. The formula below is for a 10-day EMA.

    applies a 9.52% weighting to the most recent price (2/(20+1) = .0952). Notice
    that the weighting for the shorter time period is more than the weighting for
    the longer time period. In fact, the weighting drops by half every time the moving
    average period doubles.

    turn incorporates the value for the EMA value before that, and so on. Each previous
    EMA value accounts for a small portion of the current value. Therefore, the current
    EMA value will change depending on how much past data you use in your EMA calculation.
    Ideally, for a 100% accurate EMA, you should use every data point the stock has
    ever had in calculating the EMA, starting your calculations from the first day
    the stock existed. This is not always practical, but the more data points you
    use, the more accurate your EMA will be. The goal is to maximize accuracy while
    minimizing calculation time.

    much further), resulting in EMA values that are accurate to within a fraction
    of a penny.

    moving averages, one is not necessarily better than the other. Exponential moving
    averages have less lag and are therefore more sensitive to recent prices - and
    recent price changes. Exponential moving averages will turn before simple moving
    averages. Simple moving averages, on the other hand, represent a true average
    of prices for the entire time period. As such, simple moving averages may be better

    the medium-term trend. Many chartists use the 50-day and 200-day moving averages
    together. Short-term, a 10-day moving average was quite popular in the past because
    it was easy to calculate. One simply added the numbers and moved the decimal point.

    or time filter can be applied to help prevent whipsaws. Traders might require
    the crossover to last 3 days before acting or require the 10-day EMA to move above/below
    the 50-day EMA by a certain amount before acting. Second, [MACD](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_average_convergence_divergence_macd

    can be used to identify and quantify these crossovers. MACD (10,50,1) will show
    a line representing the difference between the two exponential moving averages.
    MACD turns positive during a golden cross and negative during a dead cross. The
    Percentage Price Oscillator (PPO) can be used the same way to show percentage
    differences. Note that MACD and the PPO are based on exponential moving averages
    and will not match up with simple moving averages.

    A bullish signal is generated when prices move above the moving average. A bearish
    signal is generated when prices move below the moving average. Price crossovers
    can be combined to trade within the bigger trend. The longer moving average sets
    the tone for the bigger trend and the shorter moving average is used to generate
    the signals. One would look for bullish price crosses only when prices are already
    above the longer moving average. This would be trading in harmony with the bigger
    trend. For example, if price is above the 200-day moving average, chartists would
    only focus on signals when price moves above the 50-day moving average. Obviously,
    a move below the 50-day moving average would precede such a signal, but such bearish
    crosses would be ignored because the bigger trend is up. A bearish cross would
    simply suggest a pullback within a bigger uptrend. A cross back above the 50-day
    moving average would signal an upturn in prices and continuation of the bigger
    uptrend.

    Moving averages are trend following, or lagging, indicators that will always be
    a step behind. This is not necessarily a bad thing though. After all, the trend
    is your friend and it is best to trade in the direction of the trend. Moving averages
    ensure that a trader is in line with the current trend. Even though the trend
    is your friend, securities spend a great deal of time in trading ranges, which
    render moving averages ineffective. Once in a trend, moving averages will keep
    you in, but also give late signals. Don't expect to sell at the top and buy at
    the bottom using moving averages. As with most technical analysis tools, moving
    averages should not be used on their own, but in conjunction with other complementary
    tools. Chartists can use moving averages to define the overall trend and then
    use RSI to define [overbought or oversold](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:glossary_o#overbought

    in the calculations - “O” for the Open, “H” for the High, “L” for the Low, and

    left (past) or right (future). A negative number (-10) would shift the moving
    average to the left 10 periods. A positive number (10) would shift the moving
    average to the right 10 periods.
