- en: The StockCharts Technical Rank (SCTR) is a numerical score that ranks a stock
    within a group of stocks. The methodology for these rankings comes from the wisdom
    of John Murphy, author of many books on technical analysis and contributor to
    the Market Message at StockCharts.com. Stocks are assigned a score based on six
    key indicators, which cover different timeframes. These indicator scores are then
    sorted and assigned a technical rank. Using SCTR tables, chartists can sort stocks
    according to their technical rank. This makes it easy to identify the technical
    leaders and laggards within a specific group. Note that leveraged and inverse
    ETFs are excluded from the SCTR rankings for the ETF universe. Above average volatility
    and inverse movements skew the results. The VIX ETF (VXX) is also excluded because
    it moves inverse to the S&P 500.

    each stock is “scored” based on six different technical indicators. These six
    indicators can be subdivided into three groups: long-term, medium-term and short-term.
    The box below details these indicators, the relevant timeframe and the weightings.'

    calculate the indicator score. For example, if a stock is 15% above its 200-day
    moving average, then this indicator will contribute 4.5 points to the total indicator
    score (15 x .30 = 4.5). If the 20-day Rate-of-Change is -7%, then this indicator
    will contribute a negative 1.05 points to the total indicator score (-7 x .15
    = -1.05).

- en: For the PPO-Histogram, if its slope is greater than +1 (i.e., +45 degrees),
    5 points (5% of 100) is contributed to the total indicator score. If the PPO-Histogram's
    slope is less than -45 degrees, 0 points are contributed to the score. Otherwise,
    5% of ((Slope + 1) x 50) is contributed.

    by their indicator score. Keep in mind that these stocks are ranked solely within
    their group, such as large-caps, mid-caps and small-caps. This article will first
    show a simplified example using ten stocks sorted by indicator score. The stock
    with the highest score gets the highest technical rank (10), while the stock with
    the lowest score gets the lowest technical rank (1). The rankings are then filled
    in according to the indicator score.

    from 0.00 to 99.99, with 0 being the absolute weakest and 99.99 being the absolute
    strongest. No stock will score a perfect 100\. Second, StockCharts.com creates
    “buckets” to sort the stocks within a group. These are like percentiles. Using
    an example with a universe of 500 stocks, ten equal buckets would be created and
    each bucket would have 50 stocks (50 x 10 = 500). The 50 stocks with the lowest
    indicator scores go into the bottom bucket and have SCTRs ranging from 0 to 10\.
    The 50 stocks with the highest indicator scores go into the top bucket and have
    SCTRs ranging from 90 to 99.99\. Each bucket will then be filled accordingly and
    further sorted within the bucket. The end result is 500 stocks ranked from 0 to
    99.99 and spread relatively evenly across the ranking pool.

    It is not tethered to one specific timeframe. A stock must score well with all
    indicators and all timeframes to earn a top indicator score and technical rank.
    The indicator score puts more weight on the two long-term indicators, which account
    for 60% of the total score. This makes sense because the long-term trend is the
    strongest force. The weightings decline as scoring moves to the short-term indicators.
    The medium-term indicators account for 30% and the short-term indicators account
    for 10%. Together, the long-term and medium-term indicators account for 90% of
    the total score.

    peers, not a benchmark index. Indices, such as the S&P 500, are dominated by large-caps
    and may not truly reflect the market as a whole. Instead of benchmarking to one
    index, SCTR sorts all stocks within a specific universe, such as large-caps, mid-caps
    and small-caps. In this regard, chartists can see how Apple is performing relative
    to Amazon, IBM and other large-cap stocks.

    In any given SCTR universe, the top 10% will rank between 90 and 100, while the
    bottom 10% will rank between 0 and 10\. A stock scoring 50 would be average, showing
    neither relative strength nor relative weakness. In general, scores between 40
    and 60 are considered average. Signs of technical weakness start to appear as
    scores move below 40\. Signs of technical strength emerge when scores move above
    60.

    accounts for how far a stock is from its [200-day moving average](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_averages
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_averages"). A stock is in a long-term
    uptrend when it is above the 200-day moving average and in a long-term downtrend
    when it is below. The distance from the 200-day moving average line determines
    the trend's strength. A strong uptrend is present when price is well above the
    200-day. Conversely, a strong downtrend is present when price is well below the
    200-day.

- en: The 125-day Rate-of-Change is the second long-term indicator. This is a simple
    indicator that measures the percentage price change over the last 125 days, which
    is around six months. Strong stocks will show the largest gains, while weak stocks
    will show the largest losses. It is a straight-forward indicator designed to measure
    pure strength or weakness.

    was above 20%. Such strength in these long-term indicators packs a big positive
    punch for the technical rank.

    the 125-day Rate-of-Change is below -30%. WHR recently hit a new 52-week low,
    which is indicative of a long-term downtrend. This weakness is clearly confirmed
    by the low technical rank.

    covers around 2 1/2 months of trading. A stock is trending higher when above the
    50-day moving average and trending lower when below the 50-day. This positive
    effect is compounded when a stock is trading above both the 200-day *and* 50-day
    averages. The converse is true when a stock is trading below both moving averages.

    the percentage price change over a 20-day period, which is about a month. Again,
    stocks with big positive price changes over a 20-day period show above average
    strength that will be reflected in the technical rank. A big decline over a 20-day

    [14-day RSI](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:relative_strength_index_rsi
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:relative_strength_index_rsi") is used to gauge
    short-term momentum. Developed by Welles Wilder, this classic momentum oscillator
    fluctuates between 0 and 100\. High levels (above 60) reflect bullish momentum,
    while low levels indicate bearish momentum (below 40).
  prefs: []

- en: The 3-day slope of the PPO-Histogram is also used to gauge short-term momentum.
    The [Percentage Price Oscillator (PPO)](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:price_oscillators_ppo
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:price_oscillators_ppo") measures the percentage
    difference between the 9-day EMA and the 26-day EMA of a stock. The PPO-Histogram
    is the difference between the PPO and its 9-day EMA. In a sense, the PPO measures
    momentum and the PPO-Histogram measures the momentum of the PPO. Taking this indicator
    one step further, the 3-day Slope of the PPO-Histogram measures the degree of
    change in the PPO-Histogram over a 3-day period. The slope is simply the rise
    over the run (rise/run), which is the 3-day change in the PPO-Histogram divided
    by 3\. SharpCharts does not have an indicator for this, but a quick look at the
    charts tells us if the slope is positive or negative. We can also see when the
    slope is relatively steep or flat. A steep slope reflects a sharp change, while
    a flat slope reflects a slight change.

    Oscillator (PPO) with its histogram in the indicator window. Keep in mind that
    HD has a SCTR score of 97.4\. RSI shows strength because it was trading above
    70 at the time. In fact, notice that RSI was at its highest level in over six
    months. This strong reading contributed to the high technical rank for HD. The
    last three bars of the histogram define the slope. There is a sharp rise from
    the first bar to the third, which is a positive slope.

    Remember, WHR had a SCTR score of 3.50\. 14-day RSI bounced off its late November
    low, but remains below 50\. Short-term momentum is neutral at best, slightly bearish
    at worst. The 3-day slope for the PPO-Histogram is, however, positive. Notice
    that the first bar is in negative territory and the third bar is in positive territory.
    The rise is not that steep though. This indicates that the 3-day slope of the
    PPO-Histogram is not contributing that much to the indicator score. Also keep
    in mind that this indicator accounts for just 10% of the total score.

    strength is an important part of a successful trading or investing strategy. Based
    on the wisdom of John Murphy, SCTR allows chartists to compare the technical strength
    of one stock against all the stocks in its peer group. Chartists can also group
    stocks according to the technical rank. Stocks in the top 30% will have a technical
    rank of 70 or higher. Chartists can then focus on these relatively strong stocks
    for potential long positions on pullbacks. Conversely, chartists can use the technical
    rank to avoid weak stocks, such as those with a technical rank below 40\. As far
    as new trends emerging, chartists can look for stocks with technical ranks moving
    out of the middle zone (40-60). A move above 60 would show relative strength improving,
    while a move below 40 would show an increase in relative weakness. As with all
    technical tools, SCTR should be used in conjunction with other aspects of Technical
    Analysis.
