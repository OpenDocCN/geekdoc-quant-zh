    spent in between both floundering around. First and foremost, I hope this book
    serves as a warning to all the new traders out there. Learn from my experience:'

    to trade. Even today, I still struggle. No trading strategy lasts forever, and
    I find myself constantly reinventing my trading, and creating new strategies,
    in an attempt to stay ahead of the pack. If I relax for a while, I inevitably
    find my performance suffers.

    I certainly value the contribution of trading psychology and position sizing and
    money management, I view them as icing on the cake, with the trading strategy
    as the cake. I look at trading this way for two reasons:'

    if your strategy is a loser. Positive thinking, detailed journaling, breathing
    exercises to calm your mind, and all other mental-type activities are great, but
    they still do not take the place of a solid strategy. Many people, and many trading
    psychology coaches out there, seem to think that having the proper mind-set ensures
    profits. It is just not true.

    strategy, but conversely if you have a losing strategy, no position sizing or
    money management method will ever make you profitable. It might help you burn
    through your account more slowly, but a losing strategy is a losing strategy,
    no matter how you dress it up. Just think of trading like casino gambling—the
    house wins because it has an edge, and gamblers lose because they don’t have an
    edge. Changing bet sizes doesn’t alter the irrefutable fact: without an edge,
    eventually you will lose.'

    a lot of “grunt” work—finding ideas, testing them, refining them, and hopefully
    eventually trading them. A few years ago, I kept track of my trading strategy
    development. I found out that I had to test about 100 to 200 trading ideas before
    I found something worth trading with my own money. Most people would likely abandon
    trading long before testing 100 ideas. Others would say, “Yes, it takes Kevin
    100 ideas, but he is a dullard. I am much smarter, so it will only take me less
    than 10 ideas.” Those same people, unfortunately, usually take shortcuts or cheat
    to get what appears to be an acceptable trading system. Shortcut takers, in the
    long run, usually lose.

    through the development of two trading strategies for the euro currency futures.
    As of this writing, I am trading these with my own money, but I keep a close eye
    on their performance. In the long term, they hopefully will succeed, and as they
    do, I’ll increase my position size accordingly. If they do not succeed, then I’ll
    eventually swap them out with other strategies. Although I hope that every strategy
    I create does well, I also know that is not always the case. Surely, the performance
    of these two euro strategies so far bears that out. They are currently making
    money but underperforming, and maybe they will continue to do so, or maybe they
    will return to their long-term averages. One never knows, so I usually prepare
    for the worst, and hope for the best. Many times, the end result is somewhere
    in between.

    a good trader and follow that up with proper effort, you can be successful. I
    am living proof of that, although hopefully your journey will not take as long
    as mine did. But, to succeed long term, plan on dedicating a lot of time, effort,
    and money to the cause. Trading is like anything else good in life; if it is good,
    it is worth working for. Don’t be tempted by those offering shortcuts, easy fixes,
    magic formulas, or Holy Grail systems. Those folks will only sidetrack and derail
    your effort. Put the time in, follow an approach that other successful traders
    use, and you’ll be much better off. I wished I had taken that approach back in
    the late 1980s, when I first learned about futures trading from the Cowboy Trader.'
