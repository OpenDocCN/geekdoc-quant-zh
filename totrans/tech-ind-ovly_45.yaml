- en: RRG Relative Strength is an indicator pair designed to measure relative performance
    and the momentum of relative performance. JdK RS-Ratio is an indicator used to
    measure the relative performance of one security against another. Its companion,
    JdK RS-Momentum measures the momentum of RS-Ratio, which means it measures the
    momentum of relative performance. RS-Ratio and RS-Momentum are used in Relative
    Rotation Graphs (RRGs), but this indicator pair can also be plotted on SharpCharts.
    This article will focus on RS-Ratio and RS-Momentum as indicators on SharpCharts.
    There is another [ChartSchool article](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:chart_analysis:rrg_charts
    "chart_school:chart_analysis:rrg_charts") detailing their use in Relative Rotation
    Graphs.

    expressed in the same unit of measure and fluctuate above/below the same level
    (100). This normalization process means RS-Ratio values for different securities
    can be compared, as long as the same benchmark is used. For example, chartists
    can plot the RS-Ratio for each of the nine Sector SPDRs and use the S&P 500 as
    the benchmark. The sector with the highest RS-Ratio would show the most relative
    strength, while the sector with the lowest RS-Ratio would show the most relative
    weakness.

- en: RS-Ratio is an indicator that measures the trend for relative performance. Similar
    to the price relative, RS-Ratio uses ratio analysis to compare one security against
    another (usually the benchmark). It is designed to define the trend in relative
    performance and measure the strength of that trend.

    This indicator reflects an uptrend in relative performance when above 100 (relative
    strength) and a downtrend in relative performance when below 100 (relative weakness).
    The further the indicator is above 100, the stronger the uptrend in relative performance.
    The further the indicator is below 100, the stronger the downtrend in relative
    performance.

    model that powers RS-Ratio includes a lag period. This means there will already
    be upward movement in the price relative before RS-Ratio crosses above 100\. Conversely,
    there will already be downward movement in the price relative before RS-Ratio
    crosses below 100\. Notice on the chart above how the price relative (XLK:$SPX
    ratio) peaked in early August, but RS-Ratio did not cross below 100 until mid-October.
    Similarly, the price relative bottomed in mid-July, but RS-Ratio did not cross
    above 100 until mid-September. This is typical for trend-following indicators
    that are designed to ignore the blips and focus on the trend. The chart below
    shows the Consumer Discretionary SPDR (XLY) with another example.

    benchmark security. Let''s assume we are comparing relative performance for four
    Sector SPDRs against the S&P 500 and the RS-Ratio values are as follows: XLK=102.04,
    XLI=101.41, XLF=100.2, and XLV=103.66\. First, all four have RS-Ratios above 100
    and this means all four show relative strength (against the S&P 500). Second,
    XLV shows the most relative strength because its RS-Ratio is the highest of the
    four. XLF is the weakest of the four because its RS-Ratio is the lowest.'

    and how it relates to trend. As with price charts, chartists should keep in mind
    that momentum changes course before the trend actually reverses. Not all momentum
    moves, however, result in trend reversals.

- en: Consider an example using price and a moving average. Price first moves towards
    the moving average and then crosses the moving average if the move extends. Price,
    however, does not always cross the moving average to signal a trend reversal.
    Aggressive traders would more likely take a position as price moves towards the
    moving average because this means momentum is improving. Conservative investors
    would more likely wait for price to move above the moving average because the
    trend has not fully reversed.

    As a momentum indicator, it leads RS-Ratio and can be used to anticipate turns
    in RS-Ratio. Typically, RS-Momentum crosses above 100 when RS-Ratio is forming
    a trough and starting to move up. Conversely, RS-Momentum crosses below 100 when
    RS-Ratio is forming a peak and starting to move down.

    above 100 for four weeks. Notice how RS-Ratio bottomed as RS-Momentum moved above
    100 and RS-Ratio crossed above 100 later in January.

    it is a momentum indicator and that means it will move above/below the 100 level
    often. Chartists may want to focus on sustained moves above/below 100 to anticipate
    a similar cross in RS-Ratio.

    the relationship between RS-Momentum and RS-Ratio. The gray shading shows RS-Momentum
    below 100 for four of six weeks in February-March. Even though the indicator popped
    above 100 briefly, this pop did not last long and quickly moved back below 100\.
    This was a sign that momentum was turning negative for RS-Ratio and RS-Ratio ultimately
    crossed below 100 in the second half of March.

    RS-Ratio bottomed as RS-Momentum moved above 100, but did not cross above 100
    until the end of May. The cross above 100 in RS-Ratio, by the way, came just before
    the early June surge in XBI.

    in different conclusions. In the example below, the left chart shows two months
    of daily data for the S&P 500, and the two-month trend is down. The chart on the
    right shows one year of weekly data and the overall trend is clearly up. The yellow
    shaded area highlights the two months shown on the daily chart to put this decline
    into perspective. Clearly, this is a short-term downtrend (pullback) within a
    long-term uptrend.

    The first chart uses a weekly timeframe and both indicators are below 100, which
    indicates a downtrend in relative performance and negative momentum. This weekly
    chart captures the long-term trend. The second chart uses a daily timeframe and
    both indicators are above 100, which indicates an uptrend in relative performance
    and positive momentum. This daily chart captures a smaller trend than the weekly
    chart.

    that the long-term downtrend in relative performance will ultimately trump the
    short-term uptrend in relative performance. In other words, the uptrend in relative
    performance on the daily chart is a mere blip on the weekly chart and not enough
    to reverse the bigger downtrend in relative performance.

    different timeframes to get a complete picture. The Telecom sector is clearly
    underperforming on the weekly timeframe and momentum is negative. The upturn in
    RS-Momentum shows a decrease in negative momentum on the weekly timeframe, and
    this is reflected on the daily chart where RS-Ratio and RS-Momentum moved above
    100.

- en: RS-Ratio and RS-Momentum give chartists a four-pronged approach for measuring
    relative performance. First, RS-Ratio measures relative performance against another
    security, usually the benchmark. At its simplest, a security shows relative strength
    when above 100 and relative weakness when below 100\. Second, the RS-Ratio value
    tells us the degree of relative strength or relative weakness. The further above
    100, the more relative strength. The further below 100, the more relative weakness.
    Third, chartists can compare RS-Ratio values to determine the strongest securities
    within a group. Fourth, RS-Momentum measures the momentum of RS-Ratio and this
    can be used to anticipate turns in RS-Ratio. As with all indicators, chartists
    should combine relative performance with other technical tools to get a complete
    picture.

    grouped together as “RRG Relative Strength” in the indicator dropdown list. Once
    selected, users can set the benchmark security by entering its symbol in the “parameter”
    box. The example below shows the Consumer Discretionary SPDR (XLY) with the S&P
    500 as the benchmark. Keep in mind that any symbol can be used to measure relative
    performance. If you want to compare the performance of the Consumer Discretionary
    SPDR (XLY) to the Technology SPDR (XLK), simply enter XLK as the parameter and
    click update. [Click here](http://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=XLY&p=D&yr=0&mn=6&dy=0&id=p07575376366&a=399188908
