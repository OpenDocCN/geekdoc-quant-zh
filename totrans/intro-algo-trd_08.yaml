- en: While the results of this survey are enlightening, I should point out that it
    is not a rigorous scientific survey.  The results are probably a bit biased towards
    the top four – Tradestation, Ninja Trader, MultiCharts, and MetaTrader, since
    those are the primary platforms I use or have used.  Many survey respondents are
    familiar with my work, so it follows that they might use the same software I do.
