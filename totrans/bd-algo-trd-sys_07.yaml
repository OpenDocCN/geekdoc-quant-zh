- en: Winning the World Cup Championship of Futures Trading has made me a (very) minor
    celebrity in the small world of trading, and that is pretty neat. Both struggling
    and accomplished traders have gotten in touch with me because of my success, and
    some great relationships and trading discussions have resulted. I’ve probably
    never had a better time talking trading than I did a few years ago in Chicago,
    as I spent the day with four other World Cup Championship of Futures Trading winners.
    If only I had a tape recorder for those conversations and discussions—pure gold!
    Being a top contest performer for three consecutive years opened quite a few doors
    for me. All things considered, participating in the trading contest has been a
    very fun ride.

    in other traders can be a big help to improving your trading. So I’d like to present
    some of the most outrageous characters I’ve come across while trading, many of
    whom I’ve met because of my notoriety. Many of these people I like and have sympathy
    for, so I have changed names and certain facts so as to not upset any fragile

    paper money demo account successes. His discretionary trading performance in demo
    mode is actually quite spectacular; he can rake in probably $1,500 per day trading
    two mini S&P contracts. Plus, he is consistently profitable, and makes simulator
    money 9 days out of 10\. He’ll crow all day and all night about his trading prowess,

    some prodding, Don will admit that his last foray into real-money trading ended
    in disaster. I’ve counted at least five of these disasters over the years, and

    and paints an almost mystical story of market action. He easily explains why prices
    do what they do (note the past tense here). When I first heard about Gus, I thought,
    “He must be rich from trading, since everyone says he is top notch at analyzing
    the markets.” Well, not quite. It turns out that right now Gus isn’t trading at
    all. It seems his last account ran down to zero. Broker malfeasance, he claims,
    but it is not the first time he has had no money to trade with. Either he must

    now he sells his advice on the Internet. His pupils, enamored with their guru,

    Paul, as many as 20 in one day. Paul is convinced he has some innate ability to
    predict the direction of the market—any market. And he had no qualms about telling

    in many e-mails, when he wasn’t trying to partner with me, trying to borrow money
    from me, or trying to get me to pay him for his trading “advice.” Paul was amazed
    that Goldman Sachs wasn’t pulling out all stops to hire him (even though he never
    applied for a job there, and had no real-money trading experience), and he really
    got upset when popular trading forums banned him because of boastful posting.

    members were apparently too dimwitted to appreciate his alleged greatness. As

    that most of his writing was someone else’s. He plagiarized at least a half-dozen
    trading writers, including myself. This wasn’t an “oh, I forgot to include quotation
    marks”–type offense; it was plain out copy and paste of another’s work, passing
    it off as his own. What is even worse is that he told me it was perfectly acceptable,
    since most of the articles he stole were free anyhow. He had a big mental block
    that stealing is wrong.

  zh: 一些心理不正的人实际上并不进行交易，只是提供建议。保罗就是这样的人。作为一家外汇交易网站的受人尊敬的记者，保罗吸引了大量的阅读和评论。他看起来非常博学，我相信他凭借交易建议赚了不少钱。唯一的问题是，他大部分的写作都是别人的。他抄袭了至少半打交易作者，包括我自己。这不是“哦，我忘了加引号”那种错误；这是纯粹地复制和粘贴他人的作品，假装是自己的。更糟糕的是，他告诉我这样是完全可以接受的，因为他窃取的大多数文章反正都是免费的。他心里有个大障碍，认为偷窃是错的。

- en: Slick Sam is a combination of every slimy system vendor and trading room operator
    out there. Sam will lure you in with a free pass to his trading room or a complimentary
    webinar. Then, he’ll slowly tighten the noose, getting you to buy expensive “educational”
    materials. You’ll hear about his trades, but you’ll never see him take any trades
    live. Even if you are watching him live, he’ll be flat in an uptrend and then
    suddenly announce, “I just got out of my long position for a profit.” Or he’ll
    claim that he can’t show you his trades, but you should still believe his fantastic
    results. Once in a while, Sam will mess up, and you’ll see his trading platform
    says “demo.” Of course, whoever exposes that fact will quickly be banned from
    the room.

  zh: Slick Sam是每一个滑头系统供应商和交易室操作者的结合体。萨姆会以免费进入他的交易室或免费的网络研讨会来吸引你。然后，他会慢慢收紧绳索，让你购买昂贵的“教育”材料。你会听到他的交易，但你永远不会看到他进行任何实时交易。即使你在观看他的直播，他也会在上涨趋势中保持不动，然后突然宣布：“我刚刚以盈利退出了我的多头头寸。”或者他会声称不能向你展示他的交易，但你仍然应该相信他的惊人结果。偶尔，萨姆会搞砸，你会看到他的交易平台上显示“演示”。当然，任何揭露这一事实的人都会迅速被禁止进入房间。
- en: '**Sam’s Lesson:** Assume that each vendor you encounter is selling his secrets
    because he needs money, not because he is a do-gooder philanthropist, dedicated
    to helping newbie traders. This doesn’t mean he isn’t legitimate, but if you realize
    his true motivation (transferring your money from you to him), you’ll at least
    enter any transaction with your eyes wide open. In 20 years of trading, I’ve probably
    purchased less than 10 systems, courses, consultations, and so on. I am very picky,
    and I’ve never been blatantly ripped off. I’m proud of that fact.'

  zh: '**山姆的教训：** 假设你遇到的每个供应商都是因为需要钱而出售他的秘密，而不是因为他是个行善的慈善家，致力于帮助新手交易者。这并不意味着他不合法，但如果你意识到他的真实动机（将你的钱转移给他），你至少在进行任何交易时会保持警觉。在20年的交易中，我大概只购买过不到10个系统、课程、咨询等。我非常挑剔，从未被明显地欺诈过。对此我感到自豪。'

- en: No one is perfect, but many times even the slightest personality issue can stop
    your trading success dead in its tracks. The best advice I can give is to look
    at yourself in the mirror and be totally honest about your trading. Chances are
    that you are not the greatest trader ever, you probably cannot predict the market
    days in advance, you probably have not made millions of dollars trading and secret
    agents are not trying to steal your trading strategies. If you think you are invincible,
    real-money trading will certainly put an end to that thought. Trading is extremely
    tough, and you must be mentally sharp to compete. If your nonperfect personality
    gets in the way, the best thing to do is to get professional help, or just stay
    away from trading.

  zh: 没有人是完美的，但即使是最轻微的人格问题也可能让你的交易成功止步于此。我能给出的最好建议是对着镜子看自己，并对自己的交易保持完全诚实。你很可能不是历史上最伟大的交易者，可能无法提前几天预测市场，也可能没有在交易中赚到数百万美元，更不会有特工试图窃取你的交易策略。如果你认为自己是无敌的，真实的交易会让你放弃这个想法。交易极其困难，你必须保持心理敏锐才能竞争。如果你不完美的人格阻碍了你，最好的办法是寻求专业帮助，或者干脆远离交易。
