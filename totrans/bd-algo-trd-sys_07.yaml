- en: Winning the World Cup Championship of Futures Trading has made me a (very) minor
    celebrity in the small world of trading, and that is pretty neat. Both struggling
    and accomplished traders have gotten in touch with me because of my success, and
    some great relationships and trading discussions have resulted. I’ve probably
    never had a better time talking trading than I did a few years ago in Chicago,
    as I spent the day with four other World Cup Championship of Futures Trading winners.
    If only I had a tape recorder for those conversations and discussions—pure gold!
    Being a top contest performer for three consecutive years opened quite a few doors
    for me. All things considered, participating in the trading contest has been a
    very fun ride.

    attract people with what I’d describe as “defective” personalities: these folks
    possess some personality flaw, something they cannot see (but everyone else can),
    something that probably impacts their trading. Believe it or not, seeing flaws
    in other traders can be a big help to improving your trading. So I’d like to present
    some of the most outrageous characters I’ve come across while trading, many of
    whom I’ve met because of my notoriety. Many of these people I like and have sympathy
    for, so I have changed names and certain facts so as to not upset any fragile
    psyches. Or, as they say in movie disclaimers, “names have been changed to protect

    paper money demo account successes. His discretionary trading performance in demo
    mode is actually quite spectacular; he can rake in probably $1,500 per day trading
    two mini S&P contracts. Plus, he is consistently profitable, and makes simulator
    money 9 days out of 10\. He’ll crow all day and all night about his trading prowess,
    except when I mention real-money trading to him. Then, he grows silent, and after
    some prodding, Don will admit that his last foray into real-money trading ended
    in disaster. I’ve counted at least five of these disasters over the years, and
    each one was followed by even better demo account success. Don considers himself
    an excellent trader who just suffers unspeakable bad luck in real-money trading.

    I know a ton about him from struggling traders who’ve contacted me. According
    to these people, he is a guru’s guru. Gus times the market in exquisite fashion.
    He takes indicators, trend lines, Fibonacci numbers, and any other technical tool
    and paints an almost mystical story of market action. He easily explains why prices
    do what they do (note the past tense here). When I first heard about Gus, I thought,
    “He must be rich from trading, since everyone says he is top notch at analyzing
    the markets.” Well, not quite. It turns out that right now Gus isn’t trading at
    all. It seems his last account ran down to zero. Broker malfeasance, he claims,
    but it is not the first time he has had no money to trade with. Either he must
    run across a lot of crooked brokers or the story is more involved. In any event,
    now he sells his advice on the Internet. His pupils, enamored with their guru,
    got very confrontational with me when I suggested that maybe Gus wasn’t such a
    great trader. More than just on the hook, Gus has these fish on ice, in the cooler,
    on the boat, filleted, and ready to toss on the grill.

    take first prize. Over the past six years, I probably received 1,000 e-mails from
    Paul, as many as 20 in one day. Paul is convinced he has some innate ability to
    predict the direction of the market—any market. And he had no qualms about telling
    me about his greatness, over and over and over again. His super ability was detailed
    in many e-mails, when he wasn’t trying to partner with me, trying to borrow money
    from me, or trying to get me to pay him for his trading “advice.” Paul was amazed
    that Goldman Sachs wasn’t pulling out all stops to hire him (even though he never
    applied for a job there, and had no real-money trading experience), and he really
    got upset when popular trading forums banned him because of boastful posting.
    For the forums that did not ban him, Paul left on his own accord after realizing
    members were apparently too dimwitted to appreciate his alleged greatness. As
    far as I can tell, he may have at one time traded a $5,000 account, but it did
    not last too long. I haven’t heard from him in a while, but my guess is he is
    a snake oil vendor in the making.

    he asked. I replied as I do to all new traders with limited cash. “Your best bet
    is to study all you can, and do whatever you have to in order to get $10,000 or
    more to start trading. Anything less than this, and chances are you’ll lose it
    all. Take your time; the market will always be there.” Sage advice, if I do say
    so myself. I wish someone had given me that advice way back when. Frank, though,
    did not see it that way. He proceeded to swear up a blue storm at me, calling
    me every name in the book, claiming that I was trying to keep him from making
    money, and that he’d bankrupt me through his soon-to-be large-scale trades. He
    was probably the angriest wannabe trader person I have ever come across. After
    burning all bridges with me, he just ended up buying a robot from some Internet
    site. I found this out a few years later, when he admitted that he lost his $500
    and a bunch more afterward.
