    for the retail trader.  Trading is a tough world, but algo trading may just be
    a good route for your trading success.  If you follow the steps detailed in this

    program with it, and start developing simple trading algos.  The best way to learn
    this is by going out and actually doing it – hands on experience.  Try to become
    a “professional” with your software package.

- en: A few times in this book I have mentioned how proper strategy development is
    a whole subject onto itself.  Take some time, do some research, and search out
    experts in algo trading who are willing to share their methods.  But be careful,
    most educators are charlatans.  Ask for student references, look for independent
    verification of trading results, etc.  Be skeptical – your algo career depends
    on doing things correctly.

- en: You’ll never know if you can algo trade unless you build some strategies.  Learning
    the trading platform and programming is nice, but remember it is not the end goal. 
    Many people fall into the trap of thinking it is.  The end goal always has to
    be creating algorithmic strategies, and then trading them.  Don’t forget that!

- en: I know many wannabe traders who seem to have a lot of trading knowledge, but
    have very little actual real money trading experience.  Just remember that eventually
    will you want to trade with real money.  Many traders are afraid to.  Don’t fall
    into this trap.

- en: At the same time, don’t trade too early in your algo career, especially if you
    have limited funds.  Many traders fall into this trap, and blow out their accounts
    before they really understand what is going on.  Always remember that you want
    to be a professional trader, and always act with that in mind.

    trading process, one which includes everything from strategy development to actual
    trading.  A solid process is important, especially once it proves itself through
    market profits.  Yet, at the same time realize that along the way you may need
    to update your approach, incorporate new advancements in algo trading, etc.
