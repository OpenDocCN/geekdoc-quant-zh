    Bolt could admire. This speed is a driving force behind the frenetic blur known
    as high-frequency trading (HFT). Simply put, HFT is the use of powerful computers
    to execute a large number of orders at incredibly high speeds, often in fractions
    of a second. It's like trying to catch a speeding bullet with your own bullet.
    High-frequency data handling, therefore, is the tackling of this supersonic race
    of financial information, slicing through gigabytes of data with the precision
    of a scalpel.

    now is no longer in physical trading pits but in the realm of milliseconds and
    microseconds. The race is to the fastest – in information processing, order execution,
    and transaction speed. High-frequency data are usually sub-second data, with time
    stamp frequencies measured in milliseconds (ms) or microseconds (µs).
