- en: Moving Average Envelopes are percentage-based envelopes set above and below
    a moving average. The moving average, which forms the base for this indicator,
    can be a simple or exponential moving average. Each envelope is then set the same
    percentage above or below the moving average. This creates parallel bands that
    follow price action. With a moving average as the base, Moving Average Envelopes
    can be used as a trend following indicator. However, this indicator is not limited
    to just trend following. The envelopes can also be used to identify overbought
    and oversold levels when the trend is relatively flat.

    a simple moving average or exponential moving average. Simple moving averages
    weight each data point (price) equally. Exponential moving averages put more weight
    on recent prices and have less lag. Second, select the number of time periods
    for the moving average. Third, set the percentage for the envelopes. A 20-day
    moving average with a 2.5% envelope would show the following two lines:'

- en: Indicators based on channels, bands and envelopes are designed to encompass
    most price action. Therefore, moves above or below the envelopes warrant attention.
    Trends often start with strong moves in one direction or another. A surge above
    the upper envelope shows extraordinary strength, while a plunge below the lower
    envelope shows extraordinary weakness. Such strong moves can signal the end of
    one trend and the beginning of another.

- en: With a [moving average](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_averages
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_averages") as its foundation, Moving
    Average Envelopes are a natural trend following indicator. As with moving averages,
    the envelopes will lag price action. The direction of the moving average dictates
    the direction of the channel. In general, a downtrend is present when the channel
    moves lower, while an uptrend exists when the channel moves higher. The trend
    is flat when the channel moves sideways.

- en: Sometimes a strong trend does not take hold after an envelope break and prices
    move into a trading range. Such trading ranges are marked by a relatively flat
    moving average. The envelopes can then be used to identify overbought and oversold
    levels for trading purposes. A move above the upper envelope denotes an overbought
    situation, while a move below the lower envelope marks an oversold condition.

    objectives and the characteristics of the security involved. Traders will likely
    use shorter (faster) moving averages and relatively tight envelopes. Investors
    will likely prefer longer (slower) moving averages with wider envelopes.

    and Keltner Channels have built-in mechanisms that automatically adjust to a security's
    volatility. [Bollinger Bands](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:bollinger_bands
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:bollinger_bands") use the standard deviation
    to set bandwidth. [Keltner Channels](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:keltner_channels
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:keltner_channels") use the Average True Range
    (ATR) to set channel width. These automatically adjust for volatility. Chartists
    must independently account for volatility when setting the Moving Average Envelopes.
    Securities with high volatility will require wider bands to encompass most price
    action. Securities with low volatility can use narrower bands.

    Moving Average Envelopes and compare. The chart above shows the S&P 500 ETF with
    three Moving Average Envelopes based on the 20-day SMA. The 2.5% envelopes (red)
    were touched several times, the 5% envelopes (green) were only touched during
    the July surge. The 10% envelopes (pink) were never touched, which means this
    band is too wide. A medium-term trader might use the 5% envelopes, while a short-term
    trader could use the 2.5% envelopes.

    less volatile than individual stocks. The Alcoa chart has the same Moving Average
    Envelopes as the SPY chart. However, notice that Alcoa breached the 10% envelopes
    numerous times because it is more volatile.

- en: Moving Average Envelopes can be used to identify strong moves that signal the
    start of an extended trend. The trick, as always, is picking the correct parameters.
    This takes practice, trial and error. The chart below shows Dow Chemical (DOW)
    with the Moving Average Envelopes (20,10). Closing prices are used because moving
    averages are calculated with closing prices. Some chartists prefer bars or candlesticks
    to utilize the intraday day high and low. Notice how DOW surged above the upper
    envelope in mid-July and continued moving above this envelope until early August.
    This shows extraordinary strength. Also, note that the Moving Average Envelopes
    turned up and followed the advance. After a move from 14 to 23, the stock was
    clearly overbought. However, this move established a strong precedent that marked
    the beginning of an extended trend.

- en: With DOW becoming overbought soon after establishing its uptrend, it was time
    to wait for a playable pullback. Traders can look for pullbacks with basic chart
    analysis or with indicators. Pullbacks often come in the form of falling flags
    or wedges. DOW formed a picture perfect falling flag in August and broke resistance
    in September. Another flag formed in late October with a breakout in November.
    After the November surge, the stock pulled back with a five-week flag into December.
    The Commodity Channel Index (CCI) is shown in the indicator window. Moves below
    -100 show oversold readings. When the bigger trend is up, oversold readings can
    be used to identify pullbacks to improve the risk-reward profile for a trade.
    Momentum turns bullish again when CCI moves back into positive territory (green
    dotted lines).

    envelope signals extraordinary weakness that can foreshadow an extended downtrend.
    The chart below shows International Game Tech (IGT) breaking below the 10% envelope
    to establish a downtrend in late October 2009\. Because the stock was quite oversold
    after this sharp decline, it would have been prudent to wait for a bounce. We
    can then use basic price analysis or another momentum indicator to identify bounces.

    overbought bounces. A move above 80 is considered overbought. Once above 80, chartists
    can then look for a chart signal or a move back below 80 to signal a downturn
    (red dotted lines). The first signal was confirmed with a support break. The second
    signal resulted in a whipsaw (loss) because the stock moved above 20 a few weeks
    later. The third signal was confirmed with a trend line break that resulted in
    a rather sharp decline.

    that Moving Average Envelopes are similar to the [Percent Price Oscillator (PPO)](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:price_oscillators_ppo
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:price_oscillators_ppo"). Moving Average Envelopes
    tell us when a security is trading a certain percentage above a particular moving
    average. PPO shows the percentage difference between a short exponential moving
    average and a longer exponential moving average. PPO(1,20) shows the percentage
    difference between a 1-period EMA and a 20-period EMA. A 1-day EMA is equal to
    the close. 20-period Exponential Moving Average Envelopes reflect the same information.

    Moving Average Envelopes. Horizontal lines were set at 2.5% and -2.5% on the PPO.
    Notice that prices move above the 2.5% envelope when PPO moves above 2.5% (yellow
    shading) and prices move below the 2.5% envelope when PPO moves below -2.5% (orange
    shading). PPO is a momentum oscillator that can be used to identify overbought
    and oversold levels. By extension, Moving Average Envelopes can also be used to
    identify overbought and oversold levels. PPO uses exponential moving averages
    so it must be compared to Moving Average Envelopes using EMAs, not SMAs.

- en: Measuring overbought and oversold conditions is tricky. Securities can become
    overbought and remain overbought in a strong uptrend. Similarly, securities can
    become oversold and remain oversold in a strong downtrend. In a strong uptrend,
    prices often move above the upper envelope and continue above this line. In fact,
    the upper envelope will rise as price continues above the upper envelope. This
    may seem technically overbought, but it is a sign of strength to remain overbought.
    The reverse is true for oversold. Overbought and oversold readings are best used
    when the trend flattens.

    Envelopes (50,10). A 50-day simple moving average is in the middle (red). The
    envelopes are set 10% above and below this moving average. The chart starts with
    an overbought level that stayed overbought as a strong trend emerged in April-May.
    Price action turned choppy from June to April, which is the perfect scenario for
    overbought and oversold levels. Overbought levels in September and mid-March foreshadowed
    reversals. Similarly, oversold levels in August and late October foreshadowed
    advances. The chart ends with an oversold condition that remains oversold as a
    strong downtrend emerges.

- en: Moving Average Envelopes are mostly used as a trend following indicator, but
    can also be used to identify overbought and oversold conditions. After a consolidation
    period, a strong envelope break can signal the start of an extended trend. Once
    an uptrend is identified, chartists can turn to [momentum indicators](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:introduction_to_technical_indicators_and_oscillators#momentum_oscillators
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:introduction_to_technical_indicators_and_oscillators")
    and other techniques to identify oversold readers and pullbacks within that trend.
    Overbought conditions and bounces can be used as selling opportunities within
    a bigger downtrend. In the absence of a strong trend, the Moving Average Envelopes
    can be used like the Percent Price Oscillator. Moves above the upper envelope
    signal overbought readings, while moves below the lower envelope signal oversold
    readings. It is also important to incorporate other aspects of technical analysis
    to confirm overbought and oversold reading. Resistance and bearish reversals patterns
    can be used to corroborate overbought readings. Support and bullish reversal patterns
    can be used to affirm oversold conditions.

    selecting the indicator from the dropdown box, the default setting will appear
    in the parameters window (20,2.5). “MA Envelopes” are based on a simple moving
    average. “EMA Envelopes” are based on an exponential moving average. The first
    number (20) sets the periods for the moving average. The second number (2.5) sets
    the percentage offset. Users can change the parameters to suit their charting
    needs. The corresponding [moving average](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_averages
