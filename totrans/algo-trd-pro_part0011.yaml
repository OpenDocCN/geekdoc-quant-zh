    an expression followed by a `for` clause, and then zero or more `for` or `if`
    clauses. The expressions can be anything, meaning you can put in all kinds of
    objects in lists. The result will be a new list resulting from evaluating the
    expression in the context of the `for` and `if` clauses which follow it. For example,
    consider the scenario where we need to calculate the exponential moving average
    (EMA) for a series of closing stock prices:'

    in a single, readable line. The alternative, a for-loop, would take multiple lines
    and require manually appending each calculated EMA to a list.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Generators, on the other hand, are a breed of iterators that allow for iteration
    over a sequence of values. Unlike list comprehensions, they do not store all values
    in memory; instead, they generate each value on the fly and are thus much more
    memory-efficient. This trait is particularly useful in financial computing where
    datasets can be very large.

    complexity. Thread safety becomes a concern with threading, and inter-process

    a powerful paradigm for writing concurrent code. It is particularly well-suited
    to applications that require high I/O throughput and responsiveness, such as real-time
    data feeds in algorithmic trading systems. By using asyncio, traders can execute
    multiple I/O-bound tasks, like fetching data from different exchanges, without
    blocking the execution of other operations.

    tick data for a specific symbol. The `main` function orchestrates the concurrent
    execution of multiple tick data requests. By using `asyncio.gather`, we can run
    these requests concurrently and wait for all of them to complete. This approach
    allows us to collect and process market data with minimal latency, maintaining
    the responsiveness of the trading system.

- en: Asyncio provides a non-blocking way to perform network I/O, which is crucial
    in a domain where even milliseconds can make a significant difference. It also
    allows for more readable code compared to threading or multiprocessing, as it
    avoids the complications of managing threads or processes directly.

    conditions, reacting to price changes as they happen and adjusting our positions
    accordingly. The event loop at the heart of asyncio keeps our trading bot responsive,
    enabling it to execute trades, manage orders, and update strategies in an efficient
    and timely manner.

- en: In the pursuit of constructing resilient and maintainable trading algorithms,
    type annotations coupled with static type checking emerge as invaluable tools.
    Type annotations in Python serve as a form of documentation that can explicitly
    state the expected types of variables, function parameters, and return values.
    When combined with static type checking, these annotations empower developers
    to detect and correct type-related errors before runtime, fostering a more robust
    coding environment.

    trading algorithm. By being explicit about data types, we not only improve code
    readability for colleagues and collaborators but also pave the way for powerful
    static analysis tools like mypy to scrutinize our code for potential type inconsistencies.

    input prices and the output, specifying that the function expects a list of floating-point
    numbers as input and returns a list of the same type. The `period` parameter is
    annotated with `int`, indicating that it should receive an integer value.

    processed, which can be particularly useful when dealing with financial data that
    comes in various forms and structures. Static type checking tools like mypy can
    be run as part of a continuous integration pipeline to catch type errors before
    they make their way into a production environment, thus mitigating potential risks
    associated with dynamic typing.

    Variables within the body of the function can also be annotated to ensure consistency
    and clarify intent, as demonstrated with the `multiplier` variable.
