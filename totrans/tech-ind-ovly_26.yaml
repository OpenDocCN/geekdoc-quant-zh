- en: The Coppock Curve is a momentum indicator developed by Edwin “Sedge” Coppock,
    who was an economist by training. Coppock introduced the indicator in Barron's
    in October 1965\. The goal of this indicator is to identify long-term buying opportunities
    in the S&P 500 and Dow Industrials. The signal is very simple. Coppock used monthly
    data to identify buying opportunities when the indicator moved from negative territory
    to positive territory. Although Coppock did not use it for sell signals, many
    technical analysts consider a cross from positive to negative territory as a sell
    signal.

    "chart_school:technical_indicators:rate_of_change_roc_and_momentum") is a momentum
    oscillator that oscillates above and below the zero line. Coppock used 11 and
    14 periods because, according to an Episcopal priest, this was the average mourning
    period when grieving the loss of a loved one. Coppock theorized that the recovery
    period for stock market losses would be similar to this timeframe.

- en: The Rate-of-Change indicators were then smoothed with a weighted [moving average](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_averages
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_averages"). As its name implies, a weighted
    moving average puts more weight on recent data and less weight on older data.
    For example, a 3-period WMA would multiply the first data point by 1, the second
    data point by 2 and the third data point by 3\. The sum of these three numbers
    is then divided by 6, which is the sum of the weightings (1 + 2 + 3), to create
    a weighted average. The table below shows a calculation from an excel spreadsheet.

    signal triggers with a cross into positive territory, while a sell signal triggers
    with a cross into negative territory. Unsurprisingly, there have been only five
    signals since the late 1980s. The chart below shows the last four signals. The
    first signal triggered in 1988, which was after the 1987 crash.

    markets. The February 2001 sell signal would have avoided most of the bear market
    from 2000 to 2002\. The June 2008 sell signal would have gotten investors out
    before the market plunge in the second half of 2008\. These sell signals could
    have been used to simply exit the stock market and move into cash, which would
    have lowered market exposure and overall risk.

    The Rate-of-Change indicator measures momentum and the weighted moving average
    smooths the data. This means the indicator can be used on any timeframe. Intraday,
    daily and weekly data can be used to fit one's trading/investing style and time
    horizon. The chart below shows the Coppock Curve using weekly data on the Dow
    Industrials. As expected, the weekly chart produced many more signals than the
    monthly chart.

- en: In addition to different timeframes, the parameters can be adjusted to make
    the indicator faster or slower. A shorter Rate-of-Change setting will make the
    Coppock Curve more sensitive and faster, while a longer setting will make it less
    sensitive and slower. The chart below shows daily bars for the Nasdaq 100 ETF
    (QQQ) and the Coppock Curve (20,10,10). This setting makes the Coppock Curve a
    little less sensitive, which may be better suited for daily charts.

- en: The Coppock Curve is simply a smoothed momentum oscillator. Even though it was
    originally designed for monthly charts and long-term analysis, it can be used
    on intraday, daily or weekly charts and the settings can be adjusted to suit one's
    style. The main signals are generated with crosses above and below the zero line.
    More aggressive chartists can consider looking for bullish and bearish divergences
    to anticipate such crossovers. Be careful though. Divergences do not always result
    in trend reversals because the trend can simply slow and continue in the same
    direction.

    can adjust the settings by changing the numbers in the Parameters box. The indicator
    can then be positioned “behind price,” “above” the main window or “below” the
    main window. It helps to change the color when placing it behind the price. Chartists
    can also add a moving average using the “advanced” options. This moving average
    acts like a signal line, similar to [MACD](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_average_convergence_divergence_macd
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_average_convergence_divergence_macd").
