- en: Price Channels are lines set above and below the price of a security. The upper
    channel is set at the x-period high and the lower channel is set at the x-period
    low. For a 20-day Price Channel, the upper channel would equal the 20-day high
    and the lower channel would equal the 20-day low. The dotted centerline is the
    midpoint between the two channel lines. Price Channels can be used to identify
    upward thrusts that signal the start of an uptrend or downward plunges that signal
    the start of a downtrend. Price Channels can also be used to identify overbought
    or oversold levels within a bigger downtrend or uptrend.

    is the default setting in SharpCharts. Price Channels can be used on intraday,
    daily, weekly or monthly charts. The look-back period (20) can be shorter or longer.
    Shorter look-back periods, such as 10 days, produce tighter channel lines. Longer
    look-back periods produce wider channels.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Price Channel formula does not include the most recent period. Price Channels
    are based on prices prior to the current period. A 20-day Price Channel for October
    21 would be based on the 20-day high and 20-day low ending the day before, October
    20\. A channel break would not be possible if the most recent period was used.
    On the chart below, notice how prices broke above the upper price channel because
    the high was based on the next-to-the-last bar, not the current bar.

- en: Price Channels can be used to identify trend reversals or overbought/oversold
    levels that denote pullbacks within a bigger trend. A surge above the upper channel
    line shows extraordinary strength that can signal the start of an uptrend. Conversely,
    a plunge below the lower channel line shows serious weakness that can signal the
    start of a downtrend. Once an uptrend has started, chartists can move to a shorter
    timeframe to identify pullbacks with oversold readings. A move below the lower
    channel line indicates oversold conditions that can foreshadow an end to the pullback.
    Similarly, short-term bounces within a bigger uptrend can be identified with Price
    Channels. A move above the upper channel line signals [overbought](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:glossary_o#overbought
    "chart_school:glossary_o") conditions that can foreshadow an end to the bounce.

- en: Price Channels can be used to identify strong moves that may result in lasting
    trend reversals. Basically, a move above the 20-day Price Channel signals a new
    20-day high. A move above the 20-week Price Channel signals a new 20-week high.
    Obviously, a 20-week high is more consequential than a 20-day high. The choice
    of timeframe depends on your trading timeframe and rationale for using Price Channels.
    For example, chartists can use weekly charts with 20-week Price Channels to determine
    the big trend and overall trading bias.

    year period. The green arrows mark weekly highs above the upper channel line that
    signaled the start of an uptrend. The red arrows mark weekly lows below the lower
    channel that signaled the start of a downtrend. These channel breaks caught a
    few good trends, but there were two whipsaws or bad signals. Indicator signals
    are not perfect and there will be whipsaws. It is just part of the game.

    chart shows the same 4 1/2 year period with 20-week Price Channels and QQQQ as
    a close-only line plot. This eliminates the intra-week highs and lows. Notice
    that QQQQ did not close above the upper channel line in May 2008 or below the
    lower channel line in May 2010 (blue arrows). Using a close-only price chart reduces
    volatility and signals.

    "chart_school:technical_indicators:stochastic_oscillator_fast_slow_and_full")
    when one considers what the Stochastic Oscillator measures. This momentum oscillator
    measures the level of the close relative to the high-low range over a given period
    of time, say 20 days. The Stochastic Oscillator is relatively high when the close
    is near the high end of its 20-day range and low when the Stochastic Oscillator
    is near the low end of this range. Put in numbers, the Stochastic Oscillator is
    relatively high above 80 and relatively low below 20\.

- en: Let's compare the 20-day Fast Stochastic Oscillator with 20-day Price Channels.
    The Stochastic Oscillator will usually be above 80 when prices exceed the upper
    Price Channel. Similarly, the 20-day Fast Stochastic Oscillator will usually be
    below 20 when prices move below the lower Price Channel. There is a slight timing
    difference because Price Channel data ends with the prior period. Stochastic Oscillator
    data, on the other hand, ends with the current period. This means the Stochastic
    Oscillator includes the most recent price action, but Price Channels do not. Nevertheless,
    the two measure pretty much the same thing.

    the 20-day Fast Stochastic Oscillator. Prices are near the upper channel line
    when the Stochastic Oscillator is overbought (red lines). Prices are near the
    lower channel line when the Stochastic Oscillator is oversold (green lines). Prices
    are usually below the centerline of the Price Channel when the Stochastic Oscillator
    is below 50, which is its centerline (early June). Prices are usually above the
    centerline when the Stochastic Oscillator is above 50\.

    Securities can become overbought and remain overbought in a strong uptrend. Similarly,
    securities can become oversold and remain oversold in a strong downtrend. In a
    strong uptrend, prices can move above the upper channel line and continue above
    the upper channel line. In fact, the upper channel trend line will rise as price
    continues above the upper channel. This may seem technically overbought, but it
    is a sign of strength to remain overbought. Similarly, the Stochastic Oscillator
    can move above 80, which is technically overbought, and remain overbought for
    an extended period.

- en: Successful use of overbought and [oversold](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:glossary_o#oversold
    "chart_school:glossary_o") levels depends on successful trend identification.
    Once a bigger uptrend has been identified, traders can look for oversold levels
    in the smaller trend. Short-term oversold levels occur after a pullback within
    a bigger uptrend. As noted above, the weekly charts turned bullish when QQQQ surged
    above the upper channel line. Once the weekly chart is bullish, traders can turn
    to the daily chart to look for oversold signals. The weekly chart represents the
    bigger trend. The daily chart represents the smaller trend.

    is up so we would be looking for pullbacks on the daily chart. The green arrows
    show when QQQQ dipped below the 20-day Price Channel. There were two good signals
    in early July and early November. There were three touches in January-February.
    The first two signals were “early”, while the February signal was a direct hit.

- en: Inverse logic can be applied in downtrends. A weekly downtrend starts with a
    plunge below the lower channel line. Once this downtrend is established, chartists
    can turn to the daily chart to look for overbought signals. Overbought signals
    occur after a bounce within a bigger downtrend. Downtrends tend to be faster than
    uptrends. This means overbought readings may not occur during a strong or fast
    downtrend. Chartists may then need to tweak the Price Channel settings or use
    the centerline for signals. Prices are more likely to touch the centerline than
    the upper channel line.

    mark the 10-week high-low range. The centerline marks the midpoint. Securities
    that continuously exceed the upper channel line show strength. After all, it takes
    strong buying pressure to forge higher highs. Conversely, securities that continuously
    break the lower channel line show weakness. Strong selling pressure is evident
    with lower lows. Using Price Channels, chartists can determine the dominant force,
    buying pressure or selling pressure. As with all indicators, it is important to
    use other analysis techniques to confirm or refute the Price Channels. Chartists
    can use [chart patterns](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:chart_analysis:chart_patterns
    "chart_school:chart_analysis:chart_patterns"), [indicators](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators

    the default setting will appear in the parameters window (20). Users can change
    the parameters to suit their charting needs. A shorter look-back period will narrow
    the channels. A longer look-back period will widen the channels. [Click here](http://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=SPY&p=D&yr=0&mn=6&dy=0&id=p40145316764&listNum=30&a=212191178
