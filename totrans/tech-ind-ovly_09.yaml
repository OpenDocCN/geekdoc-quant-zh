- en: Developed by Welles Wilder, the Parabolic SAR refers to a price-and-time-based
    trading system. Wilder called this the “Parabolic Time/Price System.” SAR stands
    for “stop and reverse,” which is the actual indicator used in the system. **SAR
    trails price as the trend extends over time.** The indicator is below prices when
    prices are rising and above prices when prices are falling. In this regard, the
    indicator stops and reverses when the price trend reverses and breaks above or
    below the indicator.

    in Technical Trading Systems. This book also includes [RSI](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:relative_strength_index_rsi
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:relative_strength_index_rsi"), Average True
    Range (ATR), and the Directional Movement Concept (ADX). Despite being developed
    before the computer age, Wilder's indicators have stood the test of time and remain
    extremely popular.

- en: Calculation of SAR is complex with if/then variables that make it difficult
    to put in a spreadsheet. These examples will provide a general idea of how SAR
    is calculated. Because the formulas for rising and falling SAR are different,
    it is easier to divide the calculation into two parts. The first calculation covers
    rising SAR and the second covers falling SAR.

- en: SAR follows price and can be considered a trend following indicator. Once a
    downtrend reverses and starts up, SAR follows prices like a trailing stop. The
    stop continuously rises as long as the uptrend remains in place. In other words,
    SAR never decreases in an uptrend and continuously protects profits as prices
    advance. The indicator acts as a guard against the propensity to lower a stop-loss.
    Once price stops rising and reverses below SAR, a downtrend starts and SAR is
    above the price. SAR follows prices lower like a trailing stop. The stop continuously
    falls as long as the downtrend extends. Because SAR never rises in a downtrend,
    it continuously protects profits on [short positions](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:glossary_s#short_selling
    "chart_school:glossary_s").

- en: The Acceleration Factor (AF), which is also referred to as the Step, dictates
    SAR sensitivity. SharpCharts users can set the Step and the Maximum Step. As shown
    in the spreadsheet example, the Step is a multiplier that influences the rate-of-change
    in SAR. That is why it is referred to as the Acceleration Factor. Step gradually
    increases as the trend extends until it hits a maximum. **SAR sensitivity can
    be *decreased* by decreasing the Step**. A lower step moves SAR further from price,
    which makes a reversal less likely.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**SAR sensitivity can be *increased* by increasing the step.** A higher step
    moves SAR closer to the price action, which makes a reversal more likely. The
    indicator will reverse too often if the step is set too high. This will produce
    [whipsaws](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:glossary_w#whipsaw "chart_school:glossary_w")
    and fail to capture the trend. Chart 6 shows IBM with SAR (.01, .20). The step
    is .01 and the Maximum Step is .20\. Chart 7 shows IBM with a higher Step (.03).
    SAR is more sensitive in chart 7 because there are more reversals. This is because
    the Step is higher in chart 7 (.03) than chart 6 (.01).'

- en: The sensitivity of the indicator can also be adjusted using the Maximum Step.
    While the Maximum Step can influence sensitivity, the Step carries more weight
    because it sets the incremental rate-of-increase as the trend develops. Also,
    note that increasing the Step ensures that the Maximum Step will be hit quicker
    when a trend develops. Chart 8 shows Best Buy (BBY) with a Maximum Step (.10),
    which is lower than the default setting (.20). This lower Maximum Step decreases
    the sensitivity of the indicator and produces fewer reversals. Notice how this
    setting caught a two-month downtrend and a subsequent two-month uptrend. Chart
    9 shows BBY with a higher Maximum Step (.20). This higher reading produced extra
    reversals in early February and early April.

- en: The Parabolic SAR works best with trending securities, which occur roughly 30%
    of the time according to Wilder's estimates. This means the indicator will be
    prone to whipsaws over 50% of the time or when a security is not trending. After
    all, SAR is designed to catch the trend and follow it like a trailing stop. As
    with most indicators, the signal quality depends on the settings and the characteristics
    of the underlying security. The right settings combined with decent trends can
    produce a great trading system. The wrong settings will result in whipsaws, losses,
    and frustration. There is no golden rule or one-size-fits-all setting. Each security
    should be evaluated based on its own characteristics. Parabolic SAR should also
    be used in conjunction with other indicators and technical analysis techniques.
    For example, Wilder's [Average Directional Index](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:average_directional_index_adx
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:average_directional_index_adx") can be used
    to estimate the strength of the trend before considering signals.

- en: The Parabolic SAR can be found as an Overlay in SharpCharts. The default parameters
    are .02 for the Step and .20 for the Maximum Step. As shown above, these can be
    changed to suit the characteristics of an individual security. The example below
    shows the indicator in pink with prices in black/white and the chart grid removed.
    This contrast makes it easier to compare the indicator with the price action of
    the underlying security. [Click here](http://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=$SPX&p=D&b=5&g=0&id=p25997070229&listNum=30&a=202528465
