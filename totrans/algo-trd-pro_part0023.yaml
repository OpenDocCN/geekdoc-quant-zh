    theory, a beacon that has guided the valuation of European options since its inception.
    Its mathematical elegance lies in the synthesis of stochastic processes with the
    no-arbitrage principle, culminating in a formula that has become the bedrock for
    options traders worldwide. In this section, we shall construct this valuation
    model from first principles and implement it using Python, ensuring that you,
    the reader, gain not only an understanding of its theoretical underpinnings but
    also the practical ability to apply it to real-world scenarios.
