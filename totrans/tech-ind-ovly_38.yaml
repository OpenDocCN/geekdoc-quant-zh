- en: The Percentage Price Oscillator (PPO) is a momentum oscillator that measures
    the difference between two moving averages as a percentage of the larger moving
    average. As with its cousin, MACD, the Percentage Price Oscillator is shown with
    a signal line, a histogram and a centerline. Signals are generated with signal
    line crossovers, centerline crossovers, and divergences. Because these signals
    are no different than those associated with MACD, this article will focus on a
    few differences between the two. First, PPO readings are not subject to the price
    level of the security. Second, PPO readings for different securities can be compared,
    even when there are large differences in the price. See the [ChartSchool article
    on MACD](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_average_convergence_divergence_macd
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_average_convergence_divergence_macd")
    for information on signals common to both MACD and PPO.

    "chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_averages"), PPO makes this a relative
    value by dividing the difference by the slower moving average (26-day EMA). PPO
    is simply the MACD value divided by the longer moving average. The result is multiplied
    by 100 to move the decimal place two spots. The table below shows Intel (INTC)
    with values for the 12-day EMA, 26-day EMA, MACD and PPO. Intel is priced in the
    low 20s and MACD values range from -44 cents to +64 cents. PPO puts this in percentage
    terms with values ranging from -2.01 to +2.85\. It is easier to compare levels
    over time with percentages. -2.01 is equivalent to -2.01%, while +2.85 is equivalent
    to +2.85%.

    26-day EMA, but these parameters can be changed according to investor or trader
    preferences. Closing prices are used to calculate the moving averages so PPO signals
    should be measured against closing prices. A 9-day EMA of PPO is plotted as a
    signal line to identify upturns and downturns in the indicator.

- en: As with MACD, the PPO reflects the convergence and divergence of two moving
    averages. PPO is positive when the shorter moving average is above the longer
    moving average. The indicator moves further into positive territory as the shorter
    moving average distances itself from the longer moving average. This reflects
    strong upside momentum. The PPO is negative when the shorter moving average is
    below the longer moving average. Negative readings grow when the shorter moving
    average distances itself from the longer moving average (goes further negative).
    This reflects strong downside momentum. The histogram represents the difference
    between PPO and its 9-day EMA, the signal line. The histogram is positive when
    PPO is above its 9-day EMA and negative when PPO is below its 9-day EMA. The PPO-Histogram
    can be used to anticipate signal line crossovers in the PPO. See the ChartSchool
    article on the [MACD Histogram](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:macd-histogram
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:macd-histogram") for signal details.

    will have higher or lower MACD values than a low-priced security, even if volatility
    is basically equal. This is because MACD is based on the absolute difference in
    the two moving averages. Chart 2 shows Google with MACD and PPO for comparative
    purposes. The 12-day EMA is around 495, the 26-day EMA is around 512 and the difference
    is -17 (double digits). Notice that Google's MACD reached double digits on the
    upside and the downside, but the Percentage Price Oscillator ranged from +2.5
    to -3.5\. MACD values appear higher because Google is priced at a relatively high
    level. MACD for the Dow Industrials, which is above 10,000, hits triple digits
    on a regular basis. However, the PPO ranges from -2 to +2, which is a much more
    definable range.

    between MACD and PPO. In the Google example, notice how the PPO broke below the
    February low, but MACD has yet to break its February low. The lower low in the
    PPO shows expanding downside momentum.

- en: Because MACD is based on absolute levels, large price changes can affect MACD
    levels over an extended period of time. If a stock advances from 20 to 100, its
    MACD levels will be considerably smaller around 20 than around 100\. The PPO solves
    this problem by showing MACD values in percentage terms. Chart 3 shows Baidu (BIDU)
    advancing from 25 to 75 over a 12 month period. MACD values around 25-30 are going
    to be generally smaller than MACD values around 70-80\. Notice that MACD broke
    above its July and March highs, but the PPO did not break these corresponding
    highs. Also note that Baidu becomes [overbought](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:glossary_o#overbought
    "chart_school:glossary_o") when the PPO exceeds +5\.

    its values can be compared against other securities. Dell (DELL) and Hewlett Packard
    (HPQ) are in the same industry group, but their stock prices are at different
    levels. As of late May 2010, DELL was trading in the high teens and HPQ was trading
    in the mid-40s. The absolute price level has nothing to do with fundamentals,
    but it does affect the level of MACD. HPQ will no doubt have a higher MACD than
    DELL. However, we can apply the Percentage Price Oscillator (PPO) to compare momentum.
    First, notice that the PPO for DELL ranges from -4 to +4 for an 8 point range).
    The PPO for HPQ ranges from -3 to +2 for a range of 5\. Right off the bat, we
    can see that DELL is more volatile than HPQ because its PPO range is greater.
    Second, we can see that upside momentum for DELL was stronger than HPQ in March-April.
    The PPO for DELL advanced from negative territory and exceeded 4\. The PPO for
    HPQ turned positive before the PPO for DELL, but did not exceed 1.6.

- en: The Percentage Price Oscillator (PPO) generates the same signals as the MACD,
    but provides an added dimension as a percentage version of MACD. The PPO levels
    of the Dow Industrials (price ~11000) can be compared against the PPO levels of
    IBM (price ~122) because the PPO “levels” the playing field, so to speak. In addition,
    PPO levels in one security can be compared over extended periods of time, even
    if the price has doubled or tripled. This is not the case for the MACD. Despite
    its advantages, the PPO is still not the best oscillator to identify overbought
    or oversold conditions because movements are unlimited (in theory). Levels for
    [RSI](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:relative_strength_index_rsi
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:relative_strength_index_rsi") and the [Stochastic
    Oscillator](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:stochastic_oscillator_fast_slow_and_full
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:stochastic_oscillator_fast_slow_and_full")
    are limited and this makes them better suited to identify overbought and oversold
    levels.

    plot. Once the indicator is chosen from the dropdown list, the default parameter
    setting appears (12,26,9). These parameters can be adjusted to increase or decrease
    sensitivity. A slower long moving average combined with a faster short moving
    average will increase sensitivity. The histogram can be removed by setting the
    signal line parameter to 1\. This is helpful when displaying the PPO behind the
    price plot of a security. Users can even add back the signal line by applying
    a 9-day EMA to the PPO. Click “advanced options” to add the moving average as
    an overlay for an indicator. [Click here for a live example of the PPO](http://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=$INDU&p=D&yr=0&mn=6&dy=0&id=p81462571466&listNum=30&a=201062788
