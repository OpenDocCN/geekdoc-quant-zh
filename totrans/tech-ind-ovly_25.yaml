- en: Developed by Donald Lambert and featured in *Commodities* magazine in 1980,
    the Commodity Channel Index (CCI) is a versatile indicator that can be used to
    identify a new trend or warn of extreme conditions. Lambert originally developed
    CCI to identify cyclical turns in commodities, but the indicator can be successfully
    applied to indices, ETFs, stocks, and other securities. In general, CCI measures
    the current price level relative to an [average](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_averages
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_averages") price level over a given
    period of time. CCI is relatively high when prices are far above their average.
    CCI is relatively low when prices are far below their average. In this manner,
    CCI can be used to identify overbought and oversold levels.

    of CCI values would fall between -100 and +100\. This percentage also depends
    on the look-back period. A shorter CCI (10 periods) will be more [volatile](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:standard_deviation_volatility
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:standard_deviation_volatility") with a smaller
    percentage of values between +100 and -100\. Conversely, a longer CCI (40 periods)
    will have a higher percentage of values between +100 and -100.

- en: CCI measures the difference between a security's price change and its average
    price change. High positive readings indicate that prices are well above their
    average, which is a show of strength. Low negative readings indicate that prices
    are well below their average, which is a show of weakness.

    indicator. As a coincident indicator, surges above +100 reflect strong price action
    that can signal the start of an uptrend. Plunges below -100 reflect weak price
    action that can signal the start of a downtrend.

    chartists can look for overbought or oversold conditions that may foreshadow a
    mean reversion. Similarly, bullish and bearish divergences can be used to detect
    early momentum shifts and anticipate trend reversals.

    A move that exceeds this range shows unusual strength or weakness that can foreshadow
    an extended move. Think of these levels as bullish or bearish filters. Technically,
    CCI favors the bulls when positive and the bears when negative. However, using
    a simple zero line crossovers can result in many whipsaws. Although entry points
    will lag more, requiring a move above +100 for a bullish signal and a move below
    -100 for a bearish signal reduces whipsaws.

    signals within a seven-month period. Obviously, a 20-day CCI is not suited for
    long-term signals. Chartists need to use weekly or monthly charts for long-term
    signals. The stock peaked on 11-Jan and turned down. CCI moved below -100 on 22-January
    (8 days later) to signal the start of an extended move. Similarly, the stock bottomed
    on 8-February and CCI moved above +100 on 17-February (6 days later) to signal
    the start of an extended advance. CCI does not catch the exact top or bottom,
    but it can help filter out insignificant moves and focus on the larger trend.

    may have considered the stock overbought and the reward-to-risk ratio unfavorable
    at these levels. With the bullish signal in force, the focus would have been on
    bullish setups with a good reward-to-risk ratio. Notice that the stock retraced
    around 62% of the prior advance and formed a falling flag by the end of June.
    The subsequent surge above the flag trend line provided another bullish signal
    with CCI still in bull mode.

- en: Identifying overbought and oversold levels can be tricky with the Commodity
    Channel Index (CCI), or any other momentum oscillator for that matter. First,
    CCI is an unbound oscillator. Theoretically, there are no upside or downside limits.
    This makes an overbought or oversold assessment subjective. Second, securities
    can continue moving higher after an indicator becomes overbought. Likewise, securities
    can continue moving lower after an indicator becomes oversold.

- en: The definition of overbought or oversold varies for the Commodity Channel Index
    (CCI). ±100 may work in a trading range, but more extreme levels are needed for
    other situations. ±200 is a much harder level to reach and more representative
    of a true extreme. Selection of overbought/oversold levels also depends on the
    volatility of the underlying security. The CCI range for an index ETF, such as
    SPY, will usually be smaller than for most stocks, such as Google.

    added using the advanced indicators options. From early February to early October
    (2010), Google exceeded ±200 at least five times. The red dotted lines show when
    CCI moved back below +200 and the green dotted lines show when CCI moved back
    above -200\. It is important to wait for these crosses to reduce whipsaws should
    the trend extend. Such a system is not fool proof though. Notice how Google kept
    on moving higher even after CCI became overbought in mid-September and moved below
    -200\.

- en: Divergences signal a potential reversal point because directional momentum does
    not confirm price. A bullish divergence occurs when the underlying security makes
    a lower low and CCI forms a higher low, which shows less downside momentum. A
    bearish divergence forms when the security records a higher high and CCI forms
    a lower high, which shows less upside momentum. Before getting too excited about
    divergences as great reversal indicators, note that divergences can be misleading
    in a strong trend. A strong uptrend can show numerous bearish divergences before
    a top actually materializes. Conversely, bullish divergences often appear in extended
    downtrends.

- en: Confirmation holds the key to divergences. While divergences reflect a change
    in momentum that can foreshadow a trend reversal, chartists should set a confirmation
    point for CCI or the price chart. A bearish divergence can be confirmed with a
    break below zero in CCI or a support break on the price chart. Conversely, a bullish
    divergence can be confirmed with a break above zero in CCI or a resistance break
    on the price chart.

    timeframe, 40 versus 20, was used to reduce volatility. There are three sizable
    divergences over a seven-month period, which is actually quite a few for just
    seven months. First, UPS raced to new highs in early May, but CCI failed to exceed
    its March high and formed a bearish divergence. A support break on the price chart
    and CCI move into negative territory confirm this divergence a few days later.
    Second, a bullish divergence formed in early July as the stock moved to a lower
    low, but CCI formed a higher low. This divergence was confirmed with a CCI break
    into positive territory. Also notice that UPS filled the late June gap with a
    surge in early July. Third, a bearish divergence formed in early September and
    this was confirmed when CCI dipped into negative territory. Despite a CCI confirmation,
    price never broke support and the divergence did not result in a trend reversal.
    Not all divergences produce good signals.

- en: CCI is a versatile momentum oscillator that can be used to identify overbought/oversold
    levels or trend reversals. The indicator becomes overbought or oversold when it
    reaches a relative extreme. That extreme depends on the characteristics of the
    underlying security and the historical range for CCI. Volatile securities are
    likely to require greater extremes than docile securities. Trend changes can be
    identified when CCI crosses a specific threshold between zero and 100\. Regardless
    of how CCI is used, chartists should use CCI in conjunction with other indicators
    or price analysis. Another momentum oscillator would be redundant, but [On Balance
    Volume (OBV)](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:on_balance_volume_obv

    Distribution Line](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:accumulation_distribution_line
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:accumulation_distribution_line") can add value

    or behind the price plot of the underlying security. Placing CCI directly behind
    the price makes it easy to compare indicator movements with price movements. The
    default setting is 20-periods, but this can be adjusted to suit analysis needs.
    A shorter timeframe makes the indicator more sensitive. A longer timeframe makes
    it less sensitive. Members can click the green arrow next to “advanced options”
    to add horizontal lines to mark overbought or oversold levels. Two lines can be
    added by separating the numbers with a comma (200,-200). [Click here for a live
