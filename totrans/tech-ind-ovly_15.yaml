- en: Developed by Marc Chaikin, the Accumulation Distribution Line is a volume-based
    indicator designed to measure the cumulative flow of money into and out of a security.
    Chaikin originally referred to the indicator as the Cumulative Money Flow Line.
    As with cumulative indicators, the Accumulation Distribution Line is a running
    total of each period's Money Flow Volume. First, a multiplier is calculated based
    on the relationship of the close to the high-low range. Second, the Money Flow
    Multiplier is multiplied by the period's volume to come up with a Money Flow Volume.
    A running total of the Money Flow Volume forms the Accumulation Distribution Line.
    Chartists can use this indicator to affirm a security's underlying trend or anticipate
    reversals when the indicator diverges from the security price.

    First, calculate the Money Flow Multiplier. Second, multiply this value by volume
    to find the Money Flow Volume. Third, create a running total of Money Flow Volume
    to form the Accumulation Distribution Line (ADL).

- en: The Money Flow Multiplier fluctuates between +1 and -1\. As such, it holds the
    key to the Money Flow Volume and the Accumulation Distribution Line. The multiplier
    is positive when the close is in the upper half of the high-low range and negative
    when in the lower half. This makes perfect sense. Buying pressure is stronger
    than selling pressure when prices close in the upper half of the period's range
    (and vice versa). The Accumulation Distribution Line rises when the multiplier
    is positive and falls when the multiplier is negative.

    Volume is in effect reduced unless the Money Flow Multiplier is at its extremes
    (+1 or -1). The multiplier is +1 when the close is on the high and -1 when the
    close is on the low. All volume is positive when +1 and all volume is negative
    when -1\. At .50, only half of the volume translates into the period's Money Flow
    Volume. The table below shows the Money Flow Multipliers, Money Flow Volume and
    Accumulation Distribution Line for Research-in-Motion (RIMM). Notice how the multiplier
    is between .50 and 1 when the close is strong and between -.50 and -1 when the
    close is weak.

- en: The Accumulation Distribution Line is a cumulative measure of each period's
    volume flow, or money flow. A high positive multiplier combined with high volume
    shows strong buying pressure that pushes the indicator higher. Conversely, a low
    negative number combined with high volume reflects strong selling pressure that
    pushes the indicator lower. Money Flow Volume accumulates to form a line that
    either confirms or contradicts the underlying price trend. In this regard, the
    indicator is used to either reinforce the underlying trend or cast doubts on its
    sustainability. An uptrend in prices with a downtrend in the Accumulation Distribution
    Line suggests underlying selling pressure (distribution) that could foreshadow
    a bearish reversal on the price chart. A downtrend in prices with an uptrend in
    the Accumulation Distribution Line indicate underlying buying pressure (accumulation)
    that could foreshadow a bullish reversal in prices.

    volume-based indicators that sometimes move in opposite directions because their
    basic formulas are different. Joe Granville developed [On Balance Volume](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:on_balance_volume_obv
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:on_balance_volume_obv") (OBV) as a cumulative
    measure of positive and negative volume flow. OBV adds a period's total volume
    when the close is up and subtracts it when the close is down. A cumulative total
    of this positive and negative volume flow forms the OBV line. This line can then
    be compared with the price chart of the underlying security to look for divergences
    or confirmation.

- en: As the formula above shows, Chaikin took a different approach by completely
    ignoring the change from one period to the next. Instead, the Accumulation Distribution
    Line focuses on the level of the close relative to the high-low range for a given
    period (day, week, month). With this formula, a security could gap down and close
    significantly lower, but the Accumulation Distribution Line would rise if the
    close were above the midpoint of the high-low range. The chart above shows Clorox
    (CLX) with a big gap down and a close near the top of the day's high-low range.
    OBV moved sharply lower because the close was below the prior close. The Accumulation
    Distribution Line moved higher because the close was near the high of the day.

    Distribution Line reinforces an uptrend on the price chart and vice versa. The
    chart below shows Freeport McMoran (FCX) and the Accumulation Distribution Line
    advancing in February-March, declining from April to June and then advancing from
    July to January. The Accumulation Distribution Line confirmed each of these price
    trends.

    divergence forms when price moves to new lows, but the Accumulation Distribution
    Line does not confirm these lows and moves higher. A rising Accumulation Distribution
    Line shows, well, accumulation. Think of this as basically stealth buying pressure.
    Based on the theory that volume precedes price, chartists should be on alert for
    a bullish reversal on the price chart.

    Notice how it is easy to compare price action when the indicator is placed “behind”
    the price plot. The indicator (pink) and the price trend moved in unison from
    February to June. Signs of accumulation emerged as the indicator bottomed in early
    July and started moving higher. JWN moved to a new low in late August. Even though
    the indicator showed signs of buying pressure, it was important to wait for a
    bullish catalyst or confirmation on the price chart. This catalyst came as the
    stock gapped up and surged on big volume.

    Line peaking two months ahead of prices. The indicator not only peaked, but it
    also moved lower in March and April, which reflected some selling pressure. LUV
    confirmed weakness with a support break on the price chart and RSI moved below
    40 shortly afterward. RSI often trades in bull zones (40-80) and bear zones (20-60).
    [RSI](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:relative_strength_index_rsi

    zone until early May and then moved into a bear zone.

- en: The Accumulation Distribution Line is an indicator based on a derivative of
    price and volume. This makes it at least two steps removed from the actual price
    of the underlying security. Moreover, the Money Flow Multiplier does not take
    into account price changes from period to period. As such, it cannot be expected
    to always affirm price action or successfully predict price reversals with divergences.
    Sometimes there is a disconnect between prices and the indicator. Sometimes the
    Accumulation Distribution Line simply doesn't work. This is why it vitally important
    to use the Accumulation Distribution Line, and all indicators for that matter,
    in conjunction with price/trend analysis and/or other indicators.

    and bearish divergences serve as alerts for a potential reversal on the price
    chart. As with all indicators, it is important to use the Accumulation Distribution
