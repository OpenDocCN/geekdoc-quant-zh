- en: In memory of my father, who first showed me the vast landscape of finance and
    ignited in me a passion for trading. Your wisdom guided my first steps and your
    spirit continues to light my path. You were the original trader in my life, teaching
    me not just about the markets, but about character, resilience, and the value
    of a well-calculated risk. This book is a testament to your enduring influence.
    You may be gone from this world, but you will forever be the cornerstone of my
    ambitions. Thank you for being my first and best mentor. Rest in peace, Dad.
