- en: In this chapter, I am going to walk through a simple algo trading example. 
    Note that my focus here is on using the trading software – regardless of the platform
    you use, you really must be able to do these basic tasks.

- en: This example is NOT an example of the proper, or only, steps to develop a solid
    algorithm.  That is beyond the scope of this short book.  But this example will
    at least get you started with the concepts laid out in this book.

    it with your trading software.  Go to the next step only when you have mastered
    the first step.

- en: NOTE:  This strategy, as presented, is NOT a tradable strategy – it has weak
    out-of-sample performance.  It is merely an illustrative example.  The steps shown
    do not represent the strategy development process I use for my own trading (my
    trademarked Strategy Factory® process).  The key here is if you feel comfortable
    performing each of the steps I have detailed in this chapter, you have graduated
    from beginner algo level, and you can now be a serious algo strategy developer.

- en: A simple trading idea is usually the best.  In this case, I’ll create a basic
    breakout system.  The idea is that higher prices can only occur by exceeding previous
    high prices – pretty simple!
  prefs: []

- en: At the close of every bar, if the highest price is the highest closing price
    of the last “xbars,” and the 15 bar ADX (a technical indicator measure of trendiness)
    is above 20, then go long.  Do the opposite for short trades.  I’ll also include
    a simple stop loss, with no profit target (let winning trades run!).  This type
    a system is good for trends, but will likely experience a lot of whipsaw during
    non-trending markets.

- en: Optimization is a dirty word, but when used in moderation it can be useful. 
    Try to optimize the variable “xbar.”  Use a minimum value of 5 (short term) up
    to 30 (medium term) in steps of 5.  Also, optimize the stop loss, from 500 to
    1500 in steps of 500 dollars.

- en: Take a look at the optimization results.  There are 18 iterations (runs), and
    all of them are profitable.  This is generally a good sign.  The dilemma becomes,
    which parameter set to choose?  Highest Net Profit?  Average Return on Account? 
    Minimum Winning Percentage?  Just ask that question in a trading forum, and be
    prepared for a slew of answers, with pointed and sharp opinions.  The truth is
    there is no “perfect” criteria to use – it is a matter of personal preference
    and experience.

- en: Once we have our parameters chosen, it is time to run the strategy in 2017 and
    2018.  To do that, we simply change the chart end date, then review the updated
    Performance Report (not shown).  The results, while not horrible (if 2017-8 results
    were really poor it would suggest we overoptimized or curve fit too much), are
    not really good enough for trading.  At this point, the strategy should probably
    just be abandoned, since if we test again and again, our out-of-sample results
    are no longer truly out-of-sample.
