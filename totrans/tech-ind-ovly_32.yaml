- en: Developed by Donald Dorsey, the Mass Index uses the high-low range to identify
    trend reversals based on range expansions. In this sense, the Mass Index is a
    volatility indicator that does not have a directional bias. Instead, the Mass
    Index identifies range bulges that can foreshadow a reversal of the current trend.

- en: The calculation is fairly straightforward. First, the Single EMA provides the
    average for the high-low range. Second, the Double EMA provides a second smoothing
    of this volatility measure. Using a ratio of these two exponential [moving averages](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_averages
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_averages") normalizes the data series.
    This ratio shows when the Single EMA becomes large relative to the Double EMA.
    The final step, a 25-period summation, acts like a moving average to further smooth
    the data series. Overall, the Mass Index rises as the high-low range widens, and
    falls as the high-low range narrows. A spreadsheet example is shown below.

    average calculation extends back less than three months. Calculations in SharpCharts
    extend back two years, which makes the exponential moving average calculation
    more robust.[Click here to download this spreadsheet example.](/school/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=chart_school:technical_indicators_and_overlays:mass_index:cs-massindex.xls

- en: Donald Dorsey looked for “reversal bulges” to signal a trend reversal. According
    to Dorsey, a bulge occurs when the Mass Index moves above 27\. This initial bulge
    does not complete the signal though. Dorsey waited for this bulge to reverse with
    a move back below 26.50\. Once the reversal bulge is complete, traders should
    use other analysis techniques to determine the direction of the next move. Ideally,
    a downtrend followed by a reversal bulge would suggest a bullish trend reversal.
    Conversely, an uptrend followed by a reversal bulge would suggest a bearish trend
    reversal.

- en: The example above shows Chipotle with the Mass Index producing two reversal
    bulges over a 12 month period. In both cases, the trend was up when the Mass Index
    moved above 27, which means a bearish reversal was expected. The first signal
    foreshadowed a trading range. The second signal foreshadowed a sharp decline.
    Chartists looking for signals will most likely have to relax Dorsey's requirements
    for the reversal bulge because the Mass Index rarely exceeds 27\. It takes exceptional
    volatility to push the index above this level.

    One size does not fit all when it comes to volatility. In other words, chartists
    may need to compare Mass Index levels over time to identify historical highs and
    lows. A move that nears the high end of the historical range would suggest a volatility
    bulge that could foreshadow a reversal.

- en: The chart below shows International Paper with the Mass Index moving above 26
    twice. Even though the Mass Index touched 27 in August 2011, the 26 level seems
    more appropriate for a reversal bulge. Also keep in mind that August 2011 was
    an extremely volatile period for the entire stock market and this reading looks
    like an outlier. The trend was down when the Mass Index moved above 26 in August
    2011 and May 2012\. This suggested that a bullish reversal would follow and chartists
    could then use other analytical techniques to identify such a reversal.

    "chart_school:technical_indicators:trix"), which is the one-period rate-of-change
    for the triple smoothed exponential moving average. The TRIX is like the smoothed
    version of MACD. Once the reversal bulge is in place and the trading bias established,
    chartists can use the TRIX to generate a directional signal. Because the trends
    were down when these reversal bulges occurred, the trading bias was bullish and
    only bullish signals were considered. The green arrows show when the TRIX moved
    above its signal line to signal an upturn in prices.

- en: The Mass Index uses the high-low differential to provide a smoothed volatility
    measure. The indicator typically fluctuates in the mid-20s. Readings near the
    high end of the historical range suggest increasing volatility, which increases
    the chances for a trend reversal. Although Dorsey set the bulge threshold at 27,
    chartists should consider a lower threshold to produce more signals. Keep in mind
    that the Mass Index does not have a directional bias. The directional bias depends
    on the existing trend. As with all indicators, chartists should use other analysis
    techniques to complement the Mass Index.

    can adjust the summation periods by changing the number in the “parameters” box.
    The indicator can then be positioned “behind price”, “above” the main window or
    “below” the main window. Chartists can add a horizontal line by using the “advanced”
    options. This line can be used to set the thresholds for the reversal bulge signal.
