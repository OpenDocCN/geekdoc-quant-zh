    A perfectly symmetrical dataset, akin to the classic bell curve, would have a
    skewness of zero. In the real world, however, financial returns rarely adhere
    to such symmetry. Positive skewness indicates a distribution with a longer right

    the behavior of extreme values, or outliers. Excess kurtosis, the kurtosis value
    subtracted by 3 (which represents the kurtosis of a normal distribution), indicates
    how much the distribution deviates from the normal. A leptokurtic distribution,
    with excess kurtosis greater than zero, has fatter tails and a sharper peak, denoting
    a higher probability of extreme returns. A platykurtic distribution, on the other
    hand, with negative excess kurtosis, suggests thinner tails—a distribution more
    concentrated around the mean.
