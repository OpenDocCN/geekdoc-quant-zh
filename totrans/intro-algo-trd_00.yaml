    time I would hear the familiar “thunk” of a rolled up copy of the Los Angeles
    Times newspaper hitting my condo’s front door.  That was if the delivery person
    had good aim that day.  Some days the bushes nearby would welcome the paper with
    open arms (branches?) instead.  Other days the newspaper never arrived at all.
    But on this Saturday I heard the paper hit the door, and when I did, I knew it
    was time to prepare for Monday’s trading.

    apart until I found the Business section.  Towards the back was the data I was
    looking for – the information that would, in a short time, make me fabulously
    wealthy (or so I thought): the daily commodity prices for the previous day.'

    and intraday data was accessible with a few keystrokes.  This was old school to
    the max – everything was on paper!

    as it was called back then (it is Lean Hogs now).  I took the closing price for
    the nearest month’s contract, and copied it to a paper sheet that had 6 columns
    in it: date, closing price, 4 period average, 9 period average, 14 period average
    and signal.'

    would place an order to buy 1 live hog contract at the market.  I dutifully wrote
    “GO LONG” in the signal column, cementing the trade in my mind.

- en: I did not know it, but even back in those old days I was trading algorithmically,
    or “algo” trading.  I was trading according to a precise set a rules, which when
    you boil it down, is all algorithmic trading really is.

- en: Back then, traders referred to it as systematic trading, mechanical trading
    or rules based trading.  A few years ago, many people spoke of robot or “bot”
    trading.  But until recently, very few used the term algorithmic.  Yet, it is
    all basically the same thing.

- en: 'So, realize whenever someone mentions one of these terms – mechanical, systematic,
    rule based or algorithmic trading - they are likely referring to the same thing:
    a set of rules that tell you when to enter and exit a trade.  These rules could
    be on a computer, in your head, or as was the case for me in the early days, written
    on good ol’ paper.'

    there are plenty of other books available on that subject.  This book is intended
    to get you started with algo trading, with the assumption you know some trading
    basics.  I feel strongly that algo trading is a great way for smaller retail traders
    to compete against professional traders.
