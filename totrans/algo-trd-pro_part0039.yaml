    its possible loss. Defined mathematically, if one stands to gain $150 on a successful
    trade but risks losing $50, the ratio is calculated as 150:50, or more simply,
    3:1\. This signifies that for every dollar risked, three dollars could be gained,

    A bullish outlook suggests an expectation of rising market prices, whereas a bearish
