- en: Developed by Marc Chaikin, Chaikin Money Flow measures the amount of Money Flow
    Volume over a specific period. Money Flow Volume forms the basis for the Accumulation
    Distribution Line. Instead of a cumulative total of Money Flow Volume, Chaikin
    Money Flow simply sums Money Flow Volume for a specific look-back period, typically
    20 or 21 days. The resulting indicator fluctuates above/below the zero line just
    like an oscillator. Chartists weigh the balance of buying or selling pressure
    with the absolute level of Chaikin Money Flow. Chartists can also look for crosses
    above or below the zero line to identify changes on money flow.

- en: There are four steps to calculating Chaikin Money Flow (CMF). The example below
    is based on 20-periods. First, calculate the Money Flow Multiplier for each period.
    Second, multiply this value by the period's volume to find Money Flow Volume.
    Third, sum Money Flow Volume for the 20 periods and divide by the 20-period sum
    of volume.

- en: Each period's Money Flow Volume depends on the Money Flow Multiplier. This multiplier
    is positive when the close is in the upper a half of the period's high-low range
    and negative when the close is in the lower half. The multiplier equals 1 when
    the close equals the high and -1 when the close equals the low. In this way, the
    multiplier adjusts the amount of volume that ends up in Money Flow Volume. Volume
    is in effect reduced unless the Money Flow Multiplier is at its extremes (+1 or
    -1).

    (RIMM). Notice how the multiplier was near +1 on 5-Jan when the stock closed near
    its high. The multiplier dipped to -.97 on 18-Jan when the stock closed near its
    low. The multiplier finished near zero (-.07) when the stock closed near the midpoint
    of its high-low range on 29-Dec. [Click here](/school/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=chart_school:technical_indicators_and_overlays:chaikin_money_flow_cmf:cs-cmf.xls

- en: Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) is an oscillator that fluctuates between -1 and +1\.
    Rarely, if ever, will the indicator reach these extremes. It would take 20 consecutive
    closes on the high (low) for 20-day Chaikin Money Flow to reach +1 (-1). Typically,
    this oscillator fluctuates between -0.50 and +0.50 with zero as the centerline.

- en: Chaikin Money Flow measures buying and selling pressure for a given period of
    time. A move into positive territory indicates buying pressure, while a move into
    negative territory indicates selling pressure. Chartists can use the absolute
    value of Chaikin Money Flow to confirm or question the price action of the underlying.
    Positive CMF would confirm an uptrend, but negative CMF would call into question
    the strength behind an uptrend. The reverse holds true for downtrends.

    with positive or negative values. The indicator oscillates above/below the zero
    line. Generally, buying pressure is stronger when the indicator is positive and
    selling pressure is stronger when the indicator is negative.

    Chaikin Money Flow sometimes only briefly crosses the zero line with a move that
    turns the indicator barely positive or negative. There is no follow through and
    this zero line cross ends up becoming a whipsaw (bad signal). Chartists can filter
    these signals with buffers by setting the bullish threshold a little above zero
    (+0.05) and the bearish threshold a little below zero (-0.05). These thresholds
    will not entirely eliminate bad signals, but can help reduce whipsaws and filter
    out weaker signals.

- en: The chart above shows Freeport McMoran (FCX) with 20-day Chaikin Money Flow
    in the indicator window. There were at least 10 crosses of the zero line between
    February and December 2010\. Adding a small buffer greatly reduced the number
    of bullish and bearish signals. A move above +0.05 was considered bullish, while
    a move below -0.05 was considered bearish. There were only three signals. While
    these signals will come a little later, it may be worth it to reduce whipsaw.

    the May bounce. CMF moved above +0.05 for a few days, but this move failed to
    hold and the indicator broke back below -0.05 in early June. Whipsaws are going
    to happen, especially during volatile periods or when the trend flattens. CMF
    turned bullish in July and stayed bullish the rest of the year. Notice that HOG
    formed a falling wedge that retraced just over 62% in August, when CMF was still
    in bull mode. This pullback offered a second chance to partake in the CMF signal.

    Chang (PFCB) with some 18 crosses above +0.05 or below -0.05\. Basing CMF signals
    on these crosses resulted in one whipsaw after another. It is important to analyze
    the basic price trend and the characteristics of an indicator with a particular
    security. PFCB exhibits some trend, but price action within this trend is choppy
    and money flow cannot maintain a positive or negative bias. It would be better
    to find a different indicator for this stocks.

    close relative to the high-low range for a given period (day, week, month). With
    this formula, a security could gap down and close significantly lower, but the
    Money Flow Multiplier would rise if the close were above the midpoint of the high-low
    range. The chart below shows Clorox (CLX) with a big gap down and a close near
    the top of the day's high-low range. Even though the stock closed sharply lower
    on high volume, Chaikin Money Flow rose because the Money Flow Multiplier was
    positive and volume was well above average. Ignoring the change from close-to-close
    means that Chaikin Money Flow can sometimes disconnect with price.

    the day. The chart below shows Travellers (TRV) gapping up and closing over 1%
    higher on the day. Despite this jump, the close was near the low for the day,
    which insured a Money Flow Multiplier near -1\. As a result, almost all of the
    day's volume was counted as negative money flow and the Chaikin Money Flow fell.

- en: Chaikin Money Flow is an oscillator that measures buying and selling pressure
    over a set period of time. At its most basic, money flow favors the bulls when
    CMF is positive and the bears when negative. Chartists looking for quicker money
    flow shifts can look for bullish and bearish divergences. Be careful though. Selling
    pressure still has the edge in negative territory, even when there is a bullish
    divergence. This bullish divergence simply shows less selling pressure. It takes
    a move into positive territory to indicate actual buying pressure. As a money
    flow oscillator, CMF can be used in conjunction with pure price oscillators, such
    as MACD or [RSI](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:relative_strength_index_rsi
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:relative_strength_index_rsi"). As with all
    indicators, Chaikin Money Flow should not be used as a stand-alone indicator.
    Marc Chaikin also developed the [Accumulation Distribution Line](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:accumulation_distribution_line
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:accumulation_distribution_line") and the [Chaikin

    Because it is shown in area format, it is not really suited for placement behind
    the security's price plot. Once the indicator is chosen from the dropdown list,
    the default parameter appears (20). These parameters can be adjusted to increase
    or decrease sensitivity. Users can click on “advanced options” to add horizontal
    lines, moving averages or other overlays. Chartists can even plot a second and
    longer Chaikin Money Flow indicator on top of the other. Periods of overlap show
    when money flow is strong for two different periods. [Click here for a live example](http://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=AAPL&p=D&yr=0&mn=8&dy=0&id=p77394964602&listNum=30&a=223019825
