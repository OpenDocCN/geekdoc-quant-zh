- en: 'IntroductionIf you are new to algo trading, or don’t even know what algorithmic
    trading is, just stop reading now.  This book is not for you – yet.  Maybe try
    my “Intro To Algo Trading” book instead.Also, if you are a seasoned expert algo
    trader, and you are perfectly happy with your risk adjusted performance, you might
    not find a whole lot of new information in this book.  It might be better just
    to keep doing what you are doing.However, if you somewhere between beginner and
    expert, like most of us are, you are in luck. This book is really for the majority
    of traders stuck somewhere in the middle – experienced algo traders just looking
    for ideas and tips to improve their trading.  That is exactly the type of trader
    this book is for.In this book, I reveal a lot of the research I’ve done in the
    past year or two – research I have used to improve my algo trading.  By using
    the results of my work, you can use my findings to improve your strategies, too.Note
    that I do not discuss position sizing, psychology, portfolio management or other
    important topics here.  Why not?  Although I definitely think they are important,
    my objective in this book is to help traders get better at their algo trading
    system development.  Psychology is VERY important, but will not help you if you
    have terrible algo strategies!For me, successful trading starts with edges that
    you exploit via your algo trading systems.Perhaps an analogy will help.If you
    play blackjack in a casino, in the long run you will lose – pretty much guaranteed. 
    This is regardless of your position sizing, your money management approach, your
    psychology and discipline (even wisely avoiding the mind numbing free alcoholic
    drinks!).But, let’s say you learn to card count, which gives you a demonstrated
    edge.  With that edge, along with good psychology and money management, you can
    be a long term winner – that’s why the casinos will eventually ban you from playing
    – as they do not like players who have an edge!The same applies with trading. 
    When you have an edge, then all those other pieces of trading become important. 
    Simply put, it all starts with a good strategy, and that is why I focus on algo
    strategy improvement techniques in this book.I’ve broken this book into 4 major
    sections:General Tips And Helpful Advice:Chapter 1 – Is Algo Trading Getting Harder?
    – What does algo trading look like these days, compared to the past? And what
    does the future hold?Chapter 2 – Full Time Algo Trading – Can it be done?  What

    After Profitable (Or Unprofitable) Bars – Is this a good exit approach to use?For
    each chapter, I give you what I call “Algo Trading Cheat Codes.”  I boiled down
    thousands of research hours into actionable ideas.  This is really the essence
    of the book – taking what I’ve found, and putting it to use in your own testing
    and trading – without the need for you to do everything from scratch.There are
    a few other topics that did not make it into this book, which you can find at

    the time you finish this book, you likely will see other new research I have completed
    and posted to my website.  What can I say, I LOVE studying algo trading!So, let’s
    not waste any more time, let’s get started!For me, successful trading starts with
    edges that you exploit via your algo trading systems.Perhaps an analogy will help.If
    you play blackjack in a casino, in the long run you will lose – pretty much guaranteed. 
    This is regardless of your position sizing, your money management approach, your
    psychology and discipline (even wisely avoiding the mind numbing free alcoholic
    drinks!).But, let’s say you learn to card count, which gives you a demonstrated
    edge.  With that edge, along with good psychology and money management, you can
    be a long term winner – that’s why the casinos will eventually ban you from playing
    – as they do not like players who have an edge!The same applies with trading. 
    When you have an edge, then all those other pieces of trading become important. 
    Simply put, it all starts with a good strategy, and that is why I focus on algo
    strategy improvement techniques in this book.I’ve broken this book into 4 major
    sections:General Tips And Helpful Advice:Chapter 1 – Is Algo Trading Getting Harder?
    – What does algo trading look like these days, compared to the past? And what
    does the future hold?Chapter 2 – Full Time Algo Trading – Can it be done?  What
    is some helpful advice to help you in this area?Chapter 3 – 15 Algo Trading Tips
    – Tips I’ve learned over the years that will help you in your trading.Improving

    the worst?  And why?Chapter 5 – Mean Reversion Study – I test out some popular
    (and not so popular) mean reversion approaches.  How can they be used to create
    good strategies?Improving Your Existing Strategies:Chapter 6 – Risk Protection
    Techniques – How can you take an existing strategy, and make it more risk adverse?Chapter
    7 – Bull Bear Regime Trading – Does “macro environment” filtering of trades actually
    work?  If so, how can you do it?Improving Your Exits:Chapter 8 – Which Exit Is
    Best? – Results of my extensive test on exits.Chapter 9 – Reward/Risk Study –
    Is there an optimum Reward to Risk ratio?  If so, what is it?Chapter 10 – Exiting
    After Profitable (Or Unprofitable) Bars – Is this a good exit approach to use?For
    each chapter, I give you what I call “Algo Trading Cheat Codes.”  I boiled down
    thousands of research hours into actionable ideas.  This is really the essence
    of the book – taking what I’ve found, and putting it to use in your own testing
    and trading – without the need for you to do everything from scratch.There are

    the time you finish this book, you likely will see other new research I have completed
    and posted to my website.  What can I say, I LOVE studying algo trading!So, let’s
    not waste any more time, let’s get started!Chapter 10 – Exiting After Profitable
    (Or Unprofitable) Bars – Is this a good exit approach to use?For each chapter,
    I give you what I call “Algo Trading Cheat Codes.”  I boiled down thousands of
    research hours into actionable ideas.  This is really the essence of the book
    – taking what I’ve found, and putting it to use in your own testing and trading
    – without the need for you to do everything from scratch.There are a few other
    topics that did not make it into this book, which you can find at my website:Dollar
    vs ATR Stops – I have ATRs stop losses battle it out with Dollar based stop losses. 
    Who will be the winner?  [https://www.kjtradingsystems.com/algo-trading-tip-dollar-vs-atr-stop-losses.html](https://www.kjtradingsystems.com/algo-trading-tip-dollar-vs-atr-stop-losses.html)15

    a starting point for your own testing. [https://www.kjtradingsystems.com/15-algo-trading-price-patterns.html](https://www.kjtradingsystems.com/15-algo-trading-price-patterns.html)Should
