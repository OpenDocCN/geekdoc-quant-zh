- en: Developed by J. Welles Wilder, the Average True Range (ATR) is an indicator
    that measures [volatility](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:glossary_v#volatility
    "chart_school:glossary_v"). As with most of his indicators, Wilder designed ATR
    with commodities and daily prices in mind. Commodities are frequently more volatile
    than stocks. They were are often subject to gaps and limit moves, which occur
    when a commodity opens up or down its maximum allowed move for the session. A
    volatility formula based only on the high-low range would fail to capture volatility
    from gap or limit moves. Wilder created Average True Range to capture this “missing”
    volatility. It is important to remember that ATR does not provide an indication
    of price direction, just volatility.

    This book also includes the Parabolic SAR, RSI and the Directional Movement Concept
    (ADX). Despite being developed before the computer age, Wilder's indicators have
    stood the test of time and remain extremely popular.

    in measuring the distance between two points, not the direction. If the current
    period's high is above the prior period's high and the low is below the prior
    period's low, then the current period's high-low range will be used as the True
    Range. This is an outside day that would use Method 1 to calculate the TR. This
    is pretty straightforward. Methods 2 and 3 are used when there is a gap or an
    inside day. A gap occurs when the previous close is greater than the current high
    (signaling a potential gap down or limit move) or the previous close is lower
    than the current low (signaling a potential gap up or limit move). The image below
    shows examples of when methods 2 and 3 are appropriate.

- en: Typically, the Average True Range (ATR) is based on 14 periods and can be calculated
    on an intraday, daily, weekly or monthly basis. For this example, the ATR will
    be based on daily data. Because there must be a beginning, the first TR value
    is simply the High minus the Low, and the first 14-day ATR is the average of the
    daily TR values for the last 14 days. After that, Wilder sought to smooth the
    data by incorporating the previous period's ATR value.

    minus the Low (yellow cells). The first 14-day ATR value (.56)) was calculated
    by finding the average of the first 14 True Range values (blue cell). Subsequent
    ATR values were smoothed using the formula above. The spreadsheet values correspond
    with the yellow area on the chart below. Notice how ATR surged as QQQ plunged
    in May with many long candlesticks.

    Moving Averages (EMAs)](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_averages#ema_accuracy
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_averages"), ATR values depend on how
    far back you begin your calculations. The first True Range value is simply the
    current High minus the current Low and the first ATR is an average of the first
    14 True Range values. The real ATR formula does not kick in until day 15\. Even
    so, the remnants of these first two calculations “linger” to slightly affect subsequent
    ATR values. Spreadsheet values for a small subset of data may not match exactly
    with what is seen on the price chart. Decimal rounding can also slightly affect
    ATR values. On our charts, we calculate back at least 250 periods (typically much
    further), to ensure a much greater degree of accuracy for our ATR values.

- en: ATR is based on the True Range, which uses absolute price changes. As such,
    ATR reflects volatility as absolute level. In other words, ATR is not shown as
    a percentage of the current close. This means low-priced stocks will have lower
    ATR values than high price stocks. For example, a $20-30 security will have much
    lower ATR values than a $200-300 security. Because of this, ATR values are not
    comparable. Even large price movements for a single security, such as a decline
    from 70 to 20, can make long-term ATR comparisons impractical. Chart 4 shows Google
    with double-digit ATR values and chart 5 shows Microsoft with ATR values below
    1\. Despite different values, their ATR lines have similar shapes.

- en: ATR is not a directional indicator, such as MACD or RSI. Instead, ATR is a unique
    volatility indicator that reflects the degree of interest or disinterest in a
    move. Strong moves, in either direction, are often accompanied by large ranges,
    or large True Ranges. This is especially true at the beginning of a move. Uninspiring
    moves can be accompanied by relatively narrow ranges. As such, ATR can be used
    to validate the enthusiasm behind a move or breakout. A bullish reversal with
    an increase in ATR would show strong buying pressure and reinforce the reversal.
    A bearish support break with an increase in ATR would show strong selling pressure
    and reinforce the support break.

    “parameters” box to the right of the indicator contains the default value, 14,
    for the number of periods used to smooth the data. To adjust the period setting,
    highlight the default value and enter a new setting. Wilder often used an 8-period
    ATR. SharpCharts also allows users to position the indicator above, below, or
    behind the price plot. A moving average can be added to identify upturns or downturns
    in ATR. Click “advanced options” to add a moving average as an indicator overlay.

    with extremely high volatility. This simple scan searches for S&P 600 stocks that
    are in an uptrend. The final scan clause excludes high volatility stocks from
    the results. Note that the ATR is converted to a percentage of sorts so that the
    ATR of different stocks can be compared on the same scale.
