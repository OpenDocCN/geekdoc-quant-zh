- en: I wanted to throw up. The bile in my stomach had reached an unsustainable level,
    but there was no bathroom near me. Speeding down the freeway at 75 miles per hour,
    with no exit in sight, I’d have to swallow hard and accept my fate. I really wanted
    to just curl up and die. Well, not exactly. I wanted to vomit first, *then* curl
    up and die.

  zh: 我想呕吐。胃里的胆汁达到了无法承受的程度，但我周围没有洗手间。在高速公路上以75英里每小时的速度疾驰，看不到任何出口，我只能硬着头皮接受我的命运。我真的很想蜷缩起来去死。好吧，不完全是。我想先呕吐，*然后*再蜷缩起来去死。
- en: Was it trichinosis from eating pork not cooked to shoe leather consistency,
    as my Mom always predicted would happen? Nope. An undercooked juicy red hamburger
    laced with *E. coli?* Not exactly. It was meat that was the culprit, but in the
    form of live cattle. Live cattle futures, to be exact. Live cattle, all 40,000
    pounds of them, had led to my sudden urge to vomit. Specifically, bovine spongiform
    encephalopathy, more commonly known as mad cow disease. I didn’t have the disease,
    but my ill-fated speculative investment did.

  zh: 是因为吃了没煮到“鞋皮”程度的猪肉而导致的旋虫病吗，正如我妈妈总是预言的那样？不对。是夹杂着*大肠杆菌*的生煎汉堡？也不完全是。罪魁祸首确实是肉，但它是以活牛的形式出现的。准确地说，是活牛期货。所有40,000磅的活牛让我突然感到恶心。具体来说，是牛海绵状脑病，更常被称为疯牛病。我并没有得这种病，但我那场不幸的投机投资确实得了。
- en: This was at the end of December 2003, a month that had started with great personal
    and professional promise. I recently had been promoted to vice president of quality
    assurance at Argo-Tech, the midsize aerospace firm I was lucky enough to be part
    of, before it was bought out by a soulless mammoth corporation. I also had been
    honored as a “40 Under 40” recipient from *Crain’s Cleveland Business* magazine—recognized
    as one of Cleveland, Ohio’s, up-and-coming business stars under the age of 40\.
    My futures trading account was doing pretty well, to the point where I felt confident
    I knew what I was doing (many times that feeling is soon followed by a slap in
    the face by the market, but I digress). Finally, my first child was on the way
    in a few months. All things considered, I was on a roll.

  zh: 这是在2003年12月的最后时刻，那是一个充满个人和职业希望的月份。我最近被提升为阿戈科技公司的质量保证副总裁，这是一家中型航天公司，我很幸运能够参与其中，直到它被一家没有灵魂的庞大企业收购。我还曾被《克里夫兰商业》杂志评选为“40位40岁以下的杰出人才”——被认定为俄亥俄州克里夫兰新兴商业明星之一。我的期货交易账户表现良好，以至于我感觉自己知道自己在做什么（这种感觉往往在之后被市场狠狠打脸，不过我不想多说）。最后，我的第一个孩子将在几个月后出生。考虑到这一切，我的运势似乎很好。

- en: On December 12, 2003, my beautiful and amazing wife Amy and I had our first
    son, Anthony. He was two months premature and was stillborn. The joy of planning
    for the arrival of our firstborn suddenly and tragically became planning for a
    funeral and burial. It is nearly impossible to understand the gut-wrenching pain
    that comes with losing a child, until it happens to you. I certainly was not prepared
    for it. Dreams were destroyed that day, life suddenly became unfair, hope and
    joy seemed a distant memory. Needless to say, Amy and I were both mentally, physically,
    and emotionally devastated.

  zh: 在2003年12月12日，我美丽而了不起的妻子艾米和我迎来了我们的第一个儿子安东尼。他早产了两个月，而且是死胎。为我们第一个孩子的到来而进行的计划，突然间变成了为葬礼和埋葬做准备。失去孩子带来的撕心裂肺的痛苦几乎无法理解，直到它发生在你身上。我显然没有为此做好准备。那天，梦想被摧毁，生活突然变得不公，希望和快乐似乎变成了遥远的记忆。毫无疑问，艾米和我在精神上、身体上和情感上都遭受了巨大的打击。
- en: Less than a week later, on December 17, the second calamity hit. My father passed
    away on his 75th birthday. Ironically, after three open-heart bypass surgeries
    over the previous 30 years, it was not his clogged arteries that got him, but
    cancer—a nasty cancer that is common to chimney sweepers. That made sense, I suppose,
    since he was a firefighter, and in his prime chased many raccoons out of chimneys,
    as the co-owner of a pest control company. After watching him lying in bed while
    life slowly left his body, my head began spinning like a top. To say I could not
    think straight was an understatement.

  zh: 不到一周后，12月17日，第二场灾难降临。我的父亲在他75岁生日那天去世。讽刺的是，经过30年的三次心脏搭桥手术，并不是他的动脉堵塞了他，而是癌症——一种在烟囱清扫工中常见的可怕癌症。我想这也算合理，因为他是消防员，正值壮年时追赶过很多浣熊，作为一家害虫控制公司的共同老板。看着他躺在床上，生命慢慢离开他的身体，我的头开始像陀螺一样旋转。说我无法思考清楚，那简直是轻描淡写。
- en: With two such life-changing events within a week, you probably would guess that
    I would not be trading or taking up any other type of mental and emotional task.
    But you’d be wrong. I was still trading. Looking back on it now, I was completely
    crazy to trade. Yet I did. On December 23, about an hour or so before the close,
    on a whim I decided that I should buy live cattle futures. I’m sure I had my reasons,
    but I am equally sure that those reasons were contrived by my mind in order to
    justify the trade. I wasn’t in my right mind at all. I had no business trading.

  zh: 在一周内经历两次如此改变人生的事件，你可能会猜测我不会再进行交易或从事其他任何心理和情感任务。但你错了。我依然在交易。回首往事，我在交易时真是疯狂。然而，我还是这样做了。在12月23日，收盘前大约一个小时，我一时兴起决定买入活牛期货。我确信我有我的理由，但我同样确定那些理由是我脑中构造出来的，以证明这笔交易。我根本不在理智状态，根本不该交易。
- en: I’m sure you know how this story ends. After the close on December 23, the U.S.
    Department of Agriculture announced that a case of mad cow disease was found in
    the United States. The impact on the market would be terribly negative. Since
    I was long cattle futures, and the market was certainly headed for a free fall,
    my account was in for a slow death, temporarily slowed only by the daily limits
    in the futures markets. I could only lose $600 per day per contract, at least
    until the exchange expanded the daily downside limit. For my account size, having
    a “locked limit” down even with one contract was extremely painful.

  zh: 我相信你知道这个故事的结局。在12月23日收盘后，美国农业部宣布在美国发现一起疯牛病病例。对市场的影响将是非常负面的。由于我持有活牛期货，而市场显然要急剧下跌，我的账户正经历缓慢的死亡，只有期货市场的每日限额暂时减缓了这种情况。每份合约我每天最多只能损失600美元，至少在交易所扩大每日下跌限制之前。对于我的账户规模来说，即使只有一份合约的“限价”下跌也是极其痛苦的。

    trading and in life? What was I doing trading anyhow, after all the recent emotional
    hits to my psyche? And trading on a whim, a hunch? When was I going to stop such
    destructive behavior? Could I stop such destructive behavior and finally turn
    into a winning trader? Could this series of unfortunate events provide the impetus

    can make lots of money trading, but you also need to be prepared for a lot of
    losing, a lot of drawdowns, and a lot of risk. Whenever someone tells me trading
    is a piece of cake, I always suspect that they are half-baked. My story, as painful
    as it is at times, is a realistic journey for many retail traders. Of course,
    as I tell all beginners, read what I have written, but then read books by other
    traders, too. Keep an open mind to everything. After a lot of reading, you’ll
    be able to make solid judgment calls on what is correct, what is BS, and what
    you like and don’t like. The amount of misinformation about trading is staggering,
    so all beginners must be wary.

    incorrectly. If you’ve ever lost money after you started trading a strategy right
    after optimizing it, then you probably realize you were doing something wrong.

- en: Although the book is designed around algorithmic or mechanical trading, which
    is what I primarily do, discretionary traders can benefit from the concepts detailed
    in this book. Maybe there are parts of your discretionary approach that can be
    statistically tested. For example, let’s say your discretionary entry consists
    of a moving average crossover, combined with your intuition. It might be impossible
    to test your intuition, but a moving average crossover can be walk-forward tested
    and gently optimized. Or perhaps you want to evaluate breakeven or moving stops
    for your exit. There are many wrong ways to test this, but only a few correct
    ways. You’ll learn a correct way in this book. Therefore, utilizing the concepts
    in this book, you can improve your discretionary approach a great deal, all because
    you’ll know how to properly design and test a trading system. Whether it is a
    100 percent mechanical strategy, or a part mechanical and part discretionary system,
    putting actual performance numbers to entries and exits can only give you confidence
    and make for a better trading approach.
