    but there was no bathroom near me. Speeding down the freeway at 75 miles per hour,
    with no exit in sight, I’d have to swallow hard and accept my fate. I really wanted
    to just curl up and die. Well, not exactly. I wanted to vomit first, *then* curl
    up and die.

    as my Mom always predicted would happen? Nope. An undercooked juicy red hamburger
    laced with *E. coli?* Not exactly. It was meat that was the culprit, but in the
    form of live cattle. Live cattle futures, to be exact. Live cattle, all 40,000
    pounds of them, had led to my sudden urge to vomit. Specifically, bovine spongiform
    encephalopathy, more commonly known as mad cow disease. I didn’t have the disease,
    but my ill-fated speculative investment did.

- en: This was at the end of December 2003, a month that had started with great personal
    and professional promise. I recently had been promoted to vice president of quality
    assurance at Argo-Tech, the midsize aerospace firm I was lucky enough to be part
    of, before it was bought out by a soulless mammoth corporation. I also had been
    honored as a “40 Under 40” recipient from *Crain’s Cleveland Business* magazine—recognized
    as one of Cleveland, Ohio’s, up-and-coming business stars under the age of 40\.
    My futures trading account was doing pretty well, to the point where I felt confident
    I knew what I was doing (many times that feeling is soon followed by a slap in
    the face by the market, but I digress). Finally, my first child was on the way
    in a few months. All things considered, I was on a roll.

    son, Anthony. He was two months premature and was stillborn. The joy of planning
    for the arrival of our firstborn suddenly and tragically became planning for a
    funeral and burial. It is nearly impossible to understand the gut-wrenching pain
    that comes with losing a child, until it happens to you. I certainly was not prepared
    for it. Dreams were destroyed that day, life suddenly became unfair, hope and
    joy seemed a distant memory. Needless to say, Amy and I were both mentally, physically,
    and emotionally devastated.

    away on his 75th birthday. Ironically, after three open-heart bypass surgeries
    over the previous 30 years, it was not his clogged arteries that got him, but
    cancer—a nasty cancer that is common to chimney sweepers. That made sense, I suppose,
    since he was a firefighter, and in his prime chased many raccoons out of chimneys,
    as the co-owner of a pest control company. After watching him lying in bed while
    life slowly left his body, my head began spinning like a top. To say I could not
    think straight was an understatement.

    I would not be trading or taking up any other type of mental and emotional task.
    But you’d be wrong. I was still trading. Looking back on it now, I was completely
    crazy to trade. Yet I did. On December 23, about an hour or so before the close,
    on a whim I decided that I should buy live cattle futures. I’m sure I had my reasons,
    but I am equally sure that those reasons were contrived by my mind in order to
    justify the trade. I wasn’t in my right mind at all. I had no business trading.

    Department of Agriculture announced that a case of mad cow disease was found in
    the United States. The impact on the market would be terribly negative. Since
    I was long cattle futures, and the market was certainly headed for a free fall,
    my account was in for a slow death, temporarily slowed only by the daily limits
    in the futures markets. I could only lose $600 per day per contract, at least
    until the exchange expanded the daily downside limit. For my account size, having
    a “locked limit” down even with one contract was extremely painful.

- en: This was about seven times the maximum loss I had expected, and as a percentage
    of my account, it was brutal. Not the end of the world, but it really made me
    wonder. Was the past month just the start of a prolonged losing streak, both in
    trading and in life? What was I doing trading anyhow, after all the recent emotional
    hits to my psyche? And trading on a whim, a hunch? When was I going to stop such
    destructive behavior? Could I stop such destructive behavior and finally turn
    into a winning trader? Could this series of unfortunate events provide the impetus
    to rise from the ashes, to turn my trading around? So many questions—ones I had
    no answer for.

    trading life. This book documents that trading story, warts and all. Along the
    way, I got better and better at developing mechanical trading systems, and later
    in the book I show you the process I use to develop winning algorithmic trading
    systems.

- en: For beginner traders, I hope this book is an eye-opener for you. I can’t, and
    I won’t, fill your head with thoughts of trading profits raining down from the
    sky. Anyone who tells you trading is easy is flat-out lying to you. Sure, you
    can make lots of money trading, but you also need to be prepared for a lot of
    losing, a lot of drawdowns, and a lot of risk. Whenever someone tells me trading
    is a piece of cake, I always suspect that they are half-baked. My story, as painful
    as it is at times, is a realistic journey for many retail traders. Of course,
    as I tell all beginners, read what I have written, but then read books by other
    traders, too. Keep an open mind to everything. After a lot of reading, you’ll
    be able to make solid judgment calls on what is correct, what is BS, and what
    you like and don’t like. The amount of misinformation about trading is staggering,
    so all beginners must be wary.

    failures up until this point aren’t a result of psychology or confidence. Many
    trading books nowadays put a lot of emphasis on the mental aspect, but all the
    mental preparation in the world won’t help you if you are developing strategies
    incorrectly. If you’ve ever lost money after you started trading a strategy right
    after optimizing it, then you probably realize you were doing something wrong.
    The process detailed in this book should be right up your alley, since it will
    steer you in the right direction.

    in some fashion. Certainly, there are many great trading books that discuss many
    of the issues and problems that I address here. But there is always something
    new to learn, a different approach to try, and a different way to think. You probably
    find many items in this book that are different from your current method, and
    you’ll likely benefit from incorporating these new ideas in your trading.

- en: Although the book is designed around algorithmic or mechanical trading, which
    is what I primarily do, discretionary traders can benefit from the concepts detailed
    in this book. Maybe there are parts of your discretionary approach that can be
    statistically tested. For example, let’s say your discretionary entry consists
    of a moving average crossover, combined with your intuition. It might be impossible
    to test your intuition, but a moving average crossover can be walk-forward tested
    and gently optimized. Or perhaps you want to evaluate breakeven or moving stops
    for your exit. There are many wrong ways to test this, but only a few correct
    ways. You’ll learn a correct way in this book. Therefore, utilizing the concepts
    in this book, you can improve your discretionary approach a great deal, all because
    you’ll know how to properly design and test a trading system. Whether it is a
    100 percent mechanical strategy, or a part mechanical and part discretionary system,
    putting actual performance numbers to entries and exits can only give you confidence
    and make for a better trading approach.
