    "chart_school:technical_indicators:introduction_to_technical_indicators_and_oscillators")
    that measures the level of [RSI](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:relative_strength_index_rsi
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:relative_strength_index_rsi") relative to its
    high-low range over a set time period. StochRSI applies the Stochastics formula
    to RSI values, instead of price values. This makes it an indicator of an indicator.
    The result is an oscillator that fluctuates between 0 and 1.

- en: In their 1994 book, *The New Technical Trader*, Chande and Kroll explain that
    RSI can oscillate between 80 and 20 for extended periods without reaching extreme
    levels. Notice that 80 and 20 are used for overbought and oversold instead of
    the more traditional 70 and 30\. Traders looking to enter a stock based on an
    overbought or oversold reading in RSI might find themselves continuously on the
    sidelines. Chande and Kroll developed StochRSI to increase sensitivity and generate
    more overbought/oversold signals.

    number of periods. The number of periods used to calculate StochRSI is transferred

- en: It is important to remember that StochRSI is an indicator of an indicator, which
    makes it the second derivative of price. This means it is two steps (formulas)
    removed from the price of the underlying security. Price has undergone two changes
    to become StochRSI. Converting prices to RSI is one change. Converting RSI to
    the Stochastic Oscillator is the second change. This is why the end product (StochRSI)
    looks much different than the original (price).

- en: StochRSI has characteristics similar to most bound momentum oscillators. First,
    it can be used to identify overbought or oversold conditions. A move above .80
    is considered overbought, while a move below .20 is considered oversold. Second,
    it can be used to identify the short-term trend. As a bound oscillator, the centerline
    is at .50\. StochRSI reflects an uptrend when consistently above .50 and a downtrend
    when consistently below .50\. Because this indicator is quite volatile, some smoothing
    with a moving average can help for short-term trend identification.

- en: Trend identification is the key to successfully choosing between overbought
    and oversold levels. It is important to look for oversold conditions when the
    bigger trend is up and overbought conditions when the bigger trend is down. In
    other words, look for trades in the direction of the bigger trend. 14-day StochRSI
    would be considered a short-term indicator. Therefore, it is important to identify
    the medium-term trend when looking for overbought and oversold conditions.

- en: Chart 2 shows Boeing in a medium-term uptrend with StochRSI(14) becoming oversold
    in January and February. First, the medium-term was deemed up because the 10-day
    SMA was above the 60-day SMA. With an uptrend in place, oversold conditions were
    preferred to overbought conditions. StochRSI became oversold at least four times
    from December to February. For what it is worth, 14-day RSI did not become oversold
    during this timeframe because it is less sensitive. Oversold is not the same as
    bullish though. It serves as a warning to watch for a bounce. A catalyst is still
    needed to solidify the low and signal an actual upturn. In this example, chartists
    could look for prices to break above the 10-day SMA or for StochRSI to break above
    .50, its centerline.

    readings. First, the medium-term trend is down because the 10-day SMA is below
    the 60-day SMA. This means oversold readings are ignored and overbought readings
    become the focus. StochRSI moved above .80 in mid-October and early November (red
    arrows). These overbought readings suggested that the oversold bounce could end
    soon. Confirmation came when StochRSI moved back below .50 (red dotted lines).
    Chartists could also look for the stock to break back below its 10-day SMA to
    signal a short-term downturn.

- en: StochRSI is quite a volatile oscillator that frequently becomes overbought and
    oversold. For short-term trend identification, it can help to lengthen the calculation
    period and apply a short moving average to smooth the data. Momentum favors rising
    prices when the 10-day SMA of StochRSI is above .50 and falling prices when below
    .50\. Chart 4 shows Chevron (CVX) with 20-day StochRSI and a 5-day SMA of the
    indicator. The 5-day SMA moved above .50 in mid-February just after the stock
    gapped higher. The gap and moving average cross above .50 were short-term bullish
    signals. A falling flag/wedge formed in late February. Notice how CVX found support
    in the gap zone. The uptrend continued with a flag/wedge breakout and the stock
    advanced above 80\. Even though StochRSI dipped below .50 in late March, the 5-day
    SMA held above .50 to keep the uptrend alive until late April. This short-term
    signal turned into a two-month uptrend.

- en: Unfortunately, not all signals are this picture perfect. There will be whipsaws,
    even when using a 5-day SMA with 20-day StochRSI. For example, a consolidation
    during a trend can cause the 5-day SMA of StochRSI to gyrate above/below the .50
    line before continuing or reversing the trend. Chart 5 shows Yahoo! with 20-day
    StochRSI and its 5-day SMA for smoothing. The moving average broke above .50 in
    mid-February to turn momentum bullish. This was followed by a resistance breakout
    for Yahoo! on the first day of March. As the stock consolidated with a falling
    channel in late March, the 5-day SMA for StochRSI(20) dipped below .50 twice (red
    oval). These dips proved short-lived as the stock broke channel resistance and
    StochRSI moved above .80 to show strength. The trend did not end until the 5-day
    SMA moved below .50 AND Yahoo! gapped down.

    right away. The 5-day SMA for 20-day StochRSI moved below .50 to turn momentum
    bearish the second week of October. Yahoo! broke support for confirmation, but
    this break did not hold as the stock surged to 18 a few days later. The immediate
    recovery and bounce back above 17 formed a bear trap. Even though Yahoo! surged,
    the 5-day SMA for StochRSI remained below .50 and momentum did not confirm. The
    subsequent gap above 17.50 turned out to be an exhaustion gap as Yahoo! failed
    at resistance (18), filled the gap, broke support again and moved sharply lower
    into November. Talk about volatility.

- en: StochRSI is like RSI on steroids. RSI produces relatively fewer signals and
    StochRSI dramatically increases the signal count. There will be more overbought/oversold
    readings, more centerline crosses, more good signals and more bad signals. Speed
    comes at a price. This means it is important to use StochRSI with other aspects
    of technical analysis for confirmation. The examples above use gaps, support/resistance
    breaks, and price patterns to confirm StochRSI signals. Chartists can also employ
    other complementary indicators, such as On Balance Volume (OBV) or the Accumulation
    Distribution Line. These volume-based indicators do not overlap with momentum
    oscillators. Chartists should also experiment with various settings and learn
    the nuances of StochRSI before using it in the real world.
