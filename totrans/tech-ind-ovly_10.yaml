- en: '**Pivots Points are significant levels chartists can use to determine directional
    movement and potential support/resistance levels.** Pivot Points use the prior
    period''s high, low, and close to estimate future support and resistance levels.
    In this regard, Pivot Points are predictive or leading indicators. There are at
    least five different versions of Pivot Points. This article will focus on Standard
    Pivot Points, Demark Pivot Points, and Fibonacci Pivot Points.'

- en: Pivot Points were originally used by floor traders to set key levels. Floor
    traders are the original day traders. They deal in a very fast moving environment
    with a short-term focus. At the beginning of the trading day, floor traders would
    look at the previous day's high, low and close to calculate a Pivot Point for
    the current trading day. With this Pivot Point as the base, further calculations
    were used to set support 1, support 2, resistance 1, and resistance 2\. These
    levels would then be used to assist their trading throughout the day.

    low and close. In other words, Pivot Points for today's intraday charts would
    be based solely on yesterday's high, low and close. Once Pivot Points are set,
    they do not change and remain in play throughout the day.

    the Pivot Points for 30- 60- and 120-minute charts remain fixed for the entire
    week. **They do not change until the week ends and new Pivots can be calculated.**

    of the high, low and close. The middle Pivot Point is shown as a solid line between
    the support and resistance pivots. Keep in mind that the high, low and close are
    all from the prior period.

    a 15-minute chart. At the start of trading on June 9th, the Pivot Point is in
    the middle, the resistance levels are above and the support levels are below.
    These levels remain constant throughout the day.

- en: The Pivot Point sets the general tone for price action. This is the middle line
    of the group that is marked (P). A move above the Pivot Point is positive and
    shows strength. Keep in mind that this Pivot Point is based on the prior period's
    data. It is put forth in the current period as the first important level. A move
    above the Pivot Point suggests strength with a target to the first resistance.
    A break above first resistance shows even more strength with a target to the second
    resistance level.

    weakness with a target to the first support level. A break below the first support
    level shows even more weakness with a target to the second support level.

- en: Support and resistance levels based on Pivot Points can be used just like traditional
    support and resistance levels. The key is to watch price action closely when these
    levels come into play. Should prices decline to support and then firm, traders
    can look for a successful test and bounce off support. It often helps to look
    for a bullish chart pattern or indicator signal to confirm an upturn from support.
    Similarly, should prices advance to resistance and stall, traders can look for
    a failure at resistance and decline. Again, chartists should look for a bearish
    chart pattern or indicator signal to confirm a downturn from resistance.

- en: The second support and resistance levels can also be used to identify potentially
    overbought and oversold situations. A move above the second resistance level would
    show strength, but it would also indicate an overbought situation that could give
    way to a pullback. Similarly, a move below the second support would show weakness,
    but would also suggest a short-term oversold condition that could give way to
    a bounce.

- en: '**Pivot Points offer chartists a methodology to determine price direction and
    then set support and resistance levels.** It usually starts with a cross of the
    Pivot Point. Sometimes the market starts above or below the Pivot Point. Support
    and resistance come into play after the crossover. While originally designed for
    floor traders, the concepts behind Pivot Points can be applied across various
    timeframes. As with all indicators, it is important to confirm Pivot Point signals
    with other aspects of technical analysis. A bearish candlestick reversal pattern
    could confirm a reversal at second resistance. Oversold RSI could confirm oversold
    conditions at second support. An upturn in MACD could be used to confirm a successful
    support test. On a final note, sometimes the second or third support/resistance
    levels are not seen on the chart. This is simply because their levels exceed the
    price scale on the right. In other words, they are off the chart.'

    Pivot Points are the default setting and the parameters box is empty. Chartists
    can apply Fibonacci Pivot Points by putting an “F” in the parameters box and Demark
    Pivot Points by putting a “D” in the box. It is even possible to display all three
    at the same time. [Click here](http://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=$SPX&p=D&b=5&g=0&id=p75918574596&listNum=30&a=236469237

    do not want.
