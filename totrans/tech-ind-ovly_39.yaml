- en: The Percentage Volume Oscillator (PVO) is a momentum oscillator for volume.
    The PVO measures the difference between two volume-based moving averages as a
    percentage of the larger moving average. As with MACD and the [Percentage Price
    Oscillator (PPO)](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:price_oscillators_ppo
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:price_oscillators_ppo"), it is shown with a
    signal line, a histogram and a centerline. The PVO is positive when the shorter
    volume EMA is above the longer volume EMA and negative when the shorter volume
    EMA is below. This indicator can be used to define the ups and downs for volume,
    which can then be used to confirm or refute other signals. Typically, a breakout
    or support break is validated when the PVO is rising or positive.

- en: The default settings for the PVO are (12,26,9), which is the same as MACD or
    the PPO. This means the PVO is positive when the 12-day Volume EMA moves above
    the 26-day Volume EMA. The PVO is negative when the 12-day Volume EMA moves below
    the 26-day Volume EMA.

- en: The positive or negative degree depends on how far above or below. A PVO that
    equals 5 would indicate that the 12-day Volume EMA was 5% above the 26-day Volume
    EMA. A PVO that equals -3% would indicate that the 12-day Volume EMA was 3% less
    than the 26-day Volume EMA.

- en: The PVO-Histogram acts just like the MACD and PPO histograms. The PVO-Histogram
    is positive when the PVO is trading above its signal line (9-day EMA). The PVO-Histogram
    is negative when the PVO is below its signal line. Note that the PVO is multiplied
    by 100 to move the decimal point two places.

- en: Generally speaking, volume is above average when the PVO is positive and below
    average when the PVO is negative. A negative and rising PVO indicates that volume
    levels are increasing. A positive and falling PVO indicates that volume levels
    are decreasing. Chartists can use this information to confirm or refute movements
    on the price chart.

- en: Even though the PVO is based on a momentum oscillator formula, it is important
    to remember that moving averages lag. A 12-day EMA carries 12 days of volume data
    with data weighted more towards the newest data. A 26-day EMA lags even more because
    it contains 26 days of data. This means that the PVO(12,26,9) can sometimes be
    out of sync with price action.

    resistance](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:chart_analysis:support_and_resistance
    "chart_school:chart_analysis:support_and_resistance") break. We have all heard
    that volume validates a price movement. A support break on increasing volume has
    more credibility than a support break on low volume. Similarly, a resistance break
    on expanding volume shows more buying interest and this increases the chances
    of success.

    "chart_school:chart_analysis:chart_patterns:flag_pennant_continuation") breakout.
    Volume declined in August as the PVO moved lower until mid-September. The PVO
    then turned up, but did not move into positive territory until late October. This
    meant the 12-day Volume EMA finally crossed above the 26-day EMA and volume was
    increasing. VLO was still stuck in the pennant on the first PVO cross, but broke
    pennant resistance with the second PVO cross. Volume confirmed the breakout and
    VLO continued its advance.

    confirmed by surges in the PVO. The stock broke resistance at the beginning of
    August as the PVO moved into positive territory with a sharp surge. Expanding
    volume on an upside breakout is bullish. After a three-month run, the stock broke
    support with a gap and another surge in the PVO. Notice how the PVO surged to
    20 both times. This meant that the 12-day Volume EMA was some 20% above the 26-day
    Volume EMA.

    There are around 250 trading days in a year. Therefore, a 250-day EMA would represent
    average annual volume with a weighting towards the most recent periods. Using
    this for the long EMA in the PVO, we can choose a short EMA to highlight volume
    surges that are above this average. A PVO(1,250) would be positive when the 1-day
    volume was above the 250-day Volume EMA. A PVO(5,250) would be positive when the
    5-day Volume EMA is above the 250-day EMA.

    the PVO(5,250) is shown in the lower indicator window (black). The signal line
    is not shown because there is no parameter entered. PVO(5,250,9) would show the
    PVO with a 9-day EMA for the signal line.

- en: From the chart above, we can see that the PVO(1,250) turned positive when a
    volume bar surged above the 250-day EMA (green arrows). The PVO(5,250) turned
    positive when the 5-day Volume EMA moved above the 250-day Volume EMA (blue arrows).
    As one might expect, PVO(1,250) crosses the zero line more often and is just a
    little bit quicker. Basically, volume is above average when PVO(1,250) is positive
    and below average when negative. A breakout on above-average volume is more robust
    than one with below-average volume. Same thing goes for a support break.

- en: The Percentage Volume Oscillator (PVO) is a momentum indicator applied to volume.
    Volume doesn't trend so this oscillator can be quite choppy. Bullish and bearish
    divergences are not well suited for the PVO. Instead, chartists would be better
    off looking for signs of increasing volume with a move into positive territory
    and signs of decreasing volume with a move into negative territory. Increasing
    volume can validate a support or resistance break. Similarly, a surge or significant
    support break on low volume may be less robust. As with all technical indicators,
    it is important to use the Percentage Volume Oscillator (PVO) in conjunction with
    other aspects of technical analysis, such as [chart patterns](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:chart_analysis:chart_patterns
    "chart_school:chart_analysis:chart_patterns") and [momentum oscillators](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:introduction_to_technical_indicators_and_oscillators#momentum_oscillators

    Once the indicator is chosen from the dropdown list, the default parameters will
    appear (12,26,9). These parameters can be adjusted as shown in the example below.
    Click “advanced options” to add the moving average or a horizontal line to an
    indicator. In the example below, volume was added as an indicator twice in order
    to show two moving averages. The second volume indicator was placed behind the
    first volume indicator (behind ind) and the EMA was set at 250 with the advanced
    options. [Click here for a live example of the PVO](http://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=IBM&p=D&yr=0&mn=6&dy=0&id=p28625227150&listNum=30&a=217316123
