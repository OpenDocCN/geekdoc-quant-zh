    introduce a level of complexity beyond the reach of the Black-Scholes model. A
    finite difference approach would involve constructing a lattice that represents
    possible price paths of the underlying asset. At each node of this lattice, the
    option value is determined through backward induction, ensuring that the option's
    value never falls below the payoff of exercising it early.

    of the underlying option pricing partial differential equations (PDEs). This discretization
    translates the PDEs into a system of algebraic equations, which can then be methodically
