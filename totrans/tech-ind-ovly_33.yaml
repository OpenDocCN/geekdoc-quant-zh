- en: 'Developed by Gerald Appel in the late seventies, the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence
    oscillator (MACD) is one of the simplest and most effective momentum indicators
    available. The MACD turns two trend-following indicators, [moving averages](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_averages
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_averages"), into a momentum oscillator
    by subtracting the longer moving average from the shorter moving average. As a
    result, the MACD offers the best of both worlds: **trend following and momentum.**
    The MACD fluctuates above and below the zero line as the moving averages converge,
    cross and diverge. Traders can look for signal line crossovers, centerline crossovers
    and divergences to generate signals. Because the MACD is unbounded, it is not
    particularly useful for identifying overbought and oversold levels.'

    "chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_averages") (EMA) less the 26-day EMA.
    Closing prices are used for these moving averages. A 9-day EMA of the MACD Line
    is plotted with the indicator to act as a signal line and identify turns. The
    MACD Histogram represents the difference between MACD and its 9-day EMA, the Signal
    line. The histogram is positive when the MACD Line is above its Signal line and
    negative when the MACD Line is below its Signal line.

- en: As its name implies, the MACD is all about the convergence and divergence of
    the two moving averages. Convergence occurs when the moving averages move towards
    each other. Divergence occurs when the moving averages move away from each other.
    The shorter moving average (12-day) is faster and responsible for most MACD movements.
    The longer moving average (26-day) is slower and less reactive to price changes
    in the underlying security.

- en: The MACD Line oscillates above and below the zero line, which is also known
    as the centerline. These crossovers signal that the 12-day EMA has crossed the
    26-day EMA. The direction, of course, depends on the direction of the moving average
    cross. Positive MACD indicates that the 12-day EMA is above the 26-day EMA. Positive
    values increase as the shorter EMA diverges further from the longer EMA. **This
    means upside momentum is increasing.** Negative MACD values indicate that the
    12-day EMA is below the 26-day EMA. Negative values increase as the shorter EMA
    diverges further below the longer EMA. **This means downside [momentum](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:introduction_to_technical_indicators_and_oscillators#leading_indicators

    as the 12-day EMA trades below the 26-day EMA. The initial cross occurred at the
    end of September (black arrow) and the MACD moved further into negative territory
    as the 12-day EMA diverged further from the 26-day EMA. The orange area highlights
    a period of positive MACD values, which is when the 12-day EMA was above the 26-day
    EMA. Notice that the MACD Line remained below 1 during this period (red dotted
    line). This means the distance between the 12-day EMA and 26-day EMA was less
    than 1 point, which is not a big difference.

- en: Signal line crossovers are the most common MACD signals. The signal line is
    a 9-day EMA of the MACD Line. As a moving average of the indicator, it trails
    the MACD and makes it easier to spot MACD turns. A bullish crossover occurs when
    the MACD turns up and crosses above the signal line. A bearish crossover occurs
    when the MACD turns down and crosses below the signal line. Crossovers can last
    a few days or a few weeks, it all depends on the strength of the move.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Due diligence is required before relying on these common signals. Signal line
    crossovers at positive or negative extremes should be viewed with caution. Even
    though the MACD does not have upper and lower limits, chartists can estimate historical
    extremes with a simple visual assessment. It takes a strong move in the underlying
    security to push momentum to an extreme. Even though the move may continue, momentum
    is likely to slow and this will usually produce a signal line crossover at the
    extremities. Volatility in the underlying security can also increase the number
    of crossovers.

    in six months: four up and four down. There were some good signals and some bad
    signals. The yellow area highlights a period when the MACD Line surged above 2
    to reach a positive extreme. There were two bearish signal line crossovers in
    April and May, but IBM continued trending higher. Even though upward momentum
    slowed after the surge, upward momentum was still stronger than downside momentum
    in April-May. The third bearish signal line crossover in May resulted in a good
    signal.'

- en: Centerline crossovers are the next most common MACD signals. A bullish centerline
    crossover occurs when the MACD Line moves above the zero line to turn positive.
    This happens when the 12-day EMA of the underlying security moves above the 26-day
    EMA. A bearish centerline crossover occurs when the MACD moves below the zero
    line to turn negative. This happens when the 12-day EMA moves below the 26-day
    EMA.

    the strength of the trend. The MACD will remain positive as long as there is a
    sustained uptrend. The MACD will remain negative when there is a sustained downtrend.

    form when the MACD diverges from the price action of the underlying security.
    A bullish divergence forms when a security records a lower low and the MACD forms
    a higher low. The lower low in the security affirms the current downtrend, but
    the higher low in the MACD shows less downside momentum. Despite less downside
    momentum, downside momentum is still outpacing upside momentum as long as the
    MACD remains in negative territory. Slowing downside momentum can sometimes foreshadow
    a trend reversal or a sizable rally.'

    2008\. First, notice that we are using closing prices to identify the divergence.
    The MACD's moving averages are based on closing prices and we should consider
    closing prices in the security as well. Second, notice that there were clear reaction
    lows (troughs) as both Google and its MACD Line bounced in October and late November.
    Third, notice that the MACD formed a higher low as Google formed a lower low in
    November. The MACD turned up with a bullish divergence with a signal line crossover
    in early December. Google confirmed a reversal with resistance breakout.

    momentum may be less, upside momentum is still outpacing downside momentum as

    The stock forged a higher high above 28, but the MACD Line fell short of its prior
    high and formed a lower high. The subsequent signal line crossover and support
    break in the MACD were bearish. On the price chart, notice how broken support
    turned into resistance on the throwback bounce in November (red dotted line).
    This throwback provided a second chance to sell or sell short.

    in a strong uptrend, while bullish divergences occur often in a strong downtrend.
    Yes, you read that right. Uptrends often start with a strong advance that produces
    a surge in upside momentum (MACD). Even though the uptrend continues, it continues
    at a slower pace that causes the MACD to decline from its highs. Upside momentum
    may not be as strong, but upside momentum is still outpacing downside momentum
    as long as the MACD Line is above zero. The opposite occurs at the beginning of
    a strong downtrend.

    August to November 2009\. Despite less upside momentum, the ETF continued higher
    because the uptrend was strong. Notice how SPY continued its series of higher
    highs and higher lows. Remember, upside momentum is stronger than downside momentum
    as long as its MACD is positive. Its MACD (momentum) may have been less positive
    (strong) as the advance extended, but it was still largely positive.

- en: The MACD indicator is special because it brings together momentum and trend
    in one indicator. This unique blend of trend and momentum can be applied to daily,
    weekly or monthly charts. The standard setting for MACD is the difference between
    the 12 and 26-period EMAs. Chartists looking for more sensitivity may try a shorter
    short-term moving average and a longer long-term moving average. MACD(5,35,5)
    is more sensitive than MACD(12,26,9) and might be better suited for weekly charts.
    Chartists looking for less sensitivity may consider lengthening the moving averages.
    A less sensitive MACD will still oscillate above/below zero, but the centerline
    crossovers and signal line crossovers will be less frequent.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The MACD is not particularly good for identifying overbought and oversold levels.
    Even though it is possible to identify levels that are historically overbought
    or oversold, the MACD does not have any upper or lower limits to bind its movement.
    During sharp moves, the MACD can continue to over-extend beyond its historical
    extremes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, remember that the MACD Line is calculated using the actual difference
    between two moving averages. This means MACD values are dependent on the price
    of the underlying security. The MACD values for a $20 stocks may range from -1.5
    to 1.5, while the MACD values for a $100 may range from -10 to +10\. It is not
    possible to compare MACD values for a group of securities with varying prices.
    If you want to compare momentum readings, you should use [the Percentage Price
    Oscillator (PPO)](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:price_oscillators_ppo
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:price_oscillators_ppo"), instead of the MACD.

    menu, the default parameter setting appears: (12,26,9). These parameters can be
    adjusted to increase sensitivity or decrease sensitivity. The MACD Histogram appears
    with the indicator or can be added as a separate indicator. Setting the signal
    line to 1 or leaving it blank, i.e. (12,26,1) or (12,26), will remove the MACD
    Histogram and the signal line. A separate signal line, without the histogram,
