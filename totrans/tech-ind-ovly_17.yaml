- en: The Aroon Oscillator is the difference between Aroon-Up and Aroon-Down. These
    two indicators are usually plotted together for easy comparison, but chartists
    can also view the difference between these two indicators with the Aroon Oscillator.
    This indicator fluctuates between -100 and +100 with zero as the middle line.
    An upward trend bias is present when the oscillator is positive, while a downward
    trend bias exists when the oscillator is negative. Chartists can also expand the
    bull-bear threshold to identify stronger signals. See our [ChartSchool article](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:aroon
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:aroon") for more details on Aroon-Up and Aroon-Down.

- en: Aroon-Up and Aroon-Down measure the number of periods since price recorded an
    x-day high or low. Aroon Up is based on time and price highs. Aroon Down is based
    on time and price lows. For example, 25-day Aroon-Up measures the number of days
    since a 25-day high, while 25-day Aroon-Down measures the number of days since
    a 25-day low. These indicators are shown in percentage terms and fluctuate between
    0 and 100\. The Aroon Oscillator is simply Aroon-Up less Aroon-Down. The default
    parameter in SharpCharts is 25 and the example below is based on the 25-day Aroon
    Oscillator.

    or below a certain threshold requires Aroon-Up or Aroon-Down to reach a minimum
    level. For example, the oscillator equals +100 when Aroon-Up equals 100 and Aroon-Down
    equals 0\. Similarly, the Aroon Oscillator equals -100 when Aroon-Up is 0 and
    Aroon-Down is 100\. It requires some strong upward price movement for the Aroon
    Oscillator to reach +100\. Similarly, strong downward price movement is required
    for the oscillator to reach -100\.

- en: An Aroon Oscillator that equals +40 requires Aroon-Up to be at least 40, which
    means Aroon-Down would be 0\. A positive 40 could occur from an array of Aroon-Up
    and Aroon-Down combinations (40-0, 44-4, 48-8, 60-20, 72-32, 80-40 or 100-40).
    Reverse these numbers to see possible combinations that will produce a negative
    40\.

    high, while a relatively low negative number requires Aroon-Down to be relatively
    high. The table below shows an array of Aroon-Up and Aroon-Down pairings to form
    the Aroon Oscillator.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A reading above zero means that Aroon-Up is greater than Aroon-Down, which implies
    that prices are making new highs more recently than new lows. Conversely, readings
    below zero indicate that Aroon-Down is greater than Aroon-Up. This implies that
    prices are recording new lows more recently than new highs. As you can see, the
    Aroon Oscillator is either going to be positive or negative the vast majority
    of the time. This makes interpretation straight-forward. Time and price favor
    an uptrend when the indicator is positive and a downtrend when the indicator is
    negative. A positive or negative threshold can be used to define the strength
    of the trend. For example, a surge above +50 would reflect a strong upside move,
    while a plunge below -50 would indicate a strong downside move.

- en: 'Defining a general trend bias is the most basic use for the Aroon Oscillator.
    The indicator will remain in positive territory during strong uptrends and in
    negative territory during strong downtrends. Depending on the parameters, short
    trends or choppy trading can cause the indicator to move above/below zero quite
    often. The chart below shows Disney with two different Aroon Oscillator settings:
    25 days and 75 days. 25-day Aroon was much more sensitive than 75 day Aroon. Notice
    that 25-day Aroon crossed the zero line over eight times in eighteen months. 75-day
    Aroon crossed the zero line just four times. Chartists must decide their timeframe
    first and then choose the setting that best captures this timeframe. Short-term
    traders would clearly opt for a 25-day Aroon or shorter, while position traders
    looking for 2-4 month moves would opt for 75-day Aroon.'

- en: The chart also shows that the Aroon Oscillator is not immune to lag as the oscillator
    turns positive or negative after prices have already moved. The longer the parameter
    setting, the more the lag. Do not expect to pick bottoms or tops with positive
    or negative crossovers. As more of a trend following indicator, the Aroon Oscillator
    identifies moves that may be strong enough to signal the start of a sustained
    trend. Not all trends extend though.

    Widening the parameters will produce signals with more lag and a longer time horizon.
    For example, the bullish threshold could be set at +90 and the bearish threshold
    at -90\. A +90 would indicate that Aroon-Up is between 90 and 100, while Aroon-Down
    is between 0 and 10\. The opposite is true for a reading below -90\. Such strong
    readings occur after a significant move that can foreshadow the beginning of an
    extended trend. A move above +90 is considered bullish until negated with a move
    below -90\. This level is deep enough to absorb most pullbacks within an uptrend.
    Similarly, a move below -90 is deemed strong enough to signal the start of an
    extended decline. This signal is not reversed until there is a move above +90,
    which is high enough to absorb most oversold bounces.

- en: The Google (GOOG) chart shows the Aroon Oscillator(25) with horizontal lines
    at +90 and -90\. The indicator was added twice and “advanced options” were used
    to add the horizontal lines. A live example is shown in the SharpCharts section
    below. Even though these signals lag, they last longer than a simple zero line
    crossover. Clearly, these signals are not going to pick bottoms or tops because
    they occur after a significant move. Also, notice how Google moved counter to
    the signal just after the signals were given. There were two sharp pullbacks after
    the bullish signal in January 2009\. The trend continued in the direction of the
    signal after these counter-trend moves. These 90/90 signals can be used to establish
    the big trend and then trade in the direction of that trend. For example, chartists
    can focus exclusively on bullish signals when the big trend is up (Aroon > +90).
    Conversely, chartists can focus exclusively on bearish signals when the big trend
    is down (Aroon < -90). Chartists can even tweak the bullish and bearish thresholds.
    Be careful not to over-fit though.

- en: The Aroon Oscillator merges the Aroon-Up and Aroon-Down indicators into one
    indicator. This makes it easy to identify the stronger of the two. The oscillator
    is positive when Aroon-Up is stronger than Aroon-Down and negative when Aroon-Down
    is stronger than Aroon-Up. A general bullish bias is present when the oscillator
    is positive and a bearish bias exists when negative. It is tempting to look for
    bullish and bearish divergences, but the indicator was not designed for traditional
    oscillator signals. As with all technical indicators, the Aroon Oscillator should
    be used in conjunction with other aspects of technical analysis, such as [chart
    pattern analysis](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:chart_analysis:chart_patterns
    "chart_school:chart_analysis:chart_patterns") or [momentum indicators](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:introduction_to_technical_indicators_and_oscillators#momentum_oscillators

    positioned above, below or behind the price plot of the underlying security. As
    noted above, users can add two Aroon Oscillators with the same parameters and
    then click the green arrow for advanced options. Horizontal lines can then be
    added to set the bullish and bearish thresholds. These thresholds may vary according
    to the characteristics of the underlying security. Click the image below to see
    the settings. SharpCharts subscribers can even save this chart to their favorites
