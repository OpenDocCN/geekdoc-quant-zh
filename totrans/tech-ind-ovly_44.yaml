- en: Developed by J. Welles Wilder, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum
    oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. RSI oscillates
    between zero and 100\. Traditionally, and according to Wilder, RSI is considered
    overbought when above 70 and oversold when below 30\. Signals can also be generated
    by looking for divergences, failure swings, and centerline crossovers. RSI can
    also be used to identify the general trend.

    that has been featured in a number of articles, interviews, and books over the
    years. In particular, Constance Brown's book, Technical Analysis for the Trading
    Professional, features the concept of bull market and bear market ranges for RSI.
    Andrew Cardwell, Brown's RSI mentor, introduced positive and negative reversals
    for RSI. In addition, Cardwell turned the notion of divergence, literally and
    figuratively, on its head.

    to that used in calculating an exponential moving average. This also means that
    RSI values become more accurate as the calculation period extends. SharpCharts
    uses at least 250 data points prior to the starting date of any chart (assuming
    that much data exists) when calculating its RSI values. To exactly replicate our
    RSI numbers, a formula will need at least 250 data points.

- en: Wilder's formula normalizes RS and turns it into an oscillator that fluctuates
    between zero and 100\. In fact, a plot of RS looks exactly the same as a plot
    of RSI. The normalization step makes it easier to identify extremes because RSI
    is range bound. RSI is 0 when the Average Gain equals zero. Assuming a 14-period
    RSI, a zero RSI value means prices moved lower all 14 periods. There were no gains
    to measure. RSI is 100 when the Average Loss equals zero. This means prices moved
    higher all 14 periods. There were no losses to measure.

- en: 'Note: The smoothing process affects RSI values. RS values are smoothed after
    the first calculation. Average Loss equals the sum of the losses divided by 14
    for the first calculation. Subsequent calculations multiply the prior value by
    13, add the most recent value and then divide the total by 14\. This creates a
    smoothing affect. The same applies to Average Gain. Because of this smoothing,
    RSI values may differ based on the total calculation period. 250 periods will
    allow for more smoothing than 30 periods and this will slightly affect RSI values.
    Stockcharts.com goes back 250 days when possible. If Average Loss equals zero,
    a “divide by zero” situation occurs for RS and RSI is set to 100 by definition.
    Similarly, RSI equals 0 when Average Gain equals zero.'

    sensitivity or raised to decrease sensitivity. 10-day RSI is more likely to reach
    overbought or oversold levels than 20-day RSI. The look-back parameters also depend
    on a security's volatility. 14-day RSI for internet retailer Amazon (AMZN) is
    more likely to become overbought or oversold than 14-day RSI for Duke Energy (DUK),
    a utility.

    traditional levels can also be adjusted to better fit the security or analytical
    requirements. Raising overbought to 80 or lowering oversold to 20 will reduce
    the number of overbought/oversold readings. Short-term traders sometimes use 2-period
    RSI to look for overbought readings above 80 and oversold readings below 20\.

    This chart features daily bars in gray with a 1-day SMA in pink to highlight closing

    stock became oversold in late July and found support around 44 (1). Notice that
    the bottom **evolved** after the oversold reading. The stock did not bottom as
    soon as the oversold reading appeared. Bottoming can be a process. From oversold
    levels, RSI moved above 70 in mid September to become overbought. Despite this
    overbought reading, the stock did not decline. Instead, the stock stalled for
    a couple weeks and then continued higher. Three more overbought readings occurred
    before the stock finally peaked in December (2). Momentum oscillators can become
    overbought (oversold) and remain so in a strong up (down) trend. The first three
    overbought readings foreshadowed consolidations. The fourth coincided with a significant
    peak. RSI then moved from overbought to oversold in January. The final bottom
    did not coincide with the initial oversold reading as the stock ultimately bottomed
    a few weeks later around 46 (3).

    momentum does not confirm price. A bullish divergence occurs when the underlying
    security makes a lower low and RSI forms a higher low. RSI does not confirm the
    lower low and this shows strengthening momentum. A bearish divergence forms when
    the security records a higher high and RSI forms a lower high. RSI does not confirm
    the new high and this shows weakening momentum. Chart 5 shows Ebay (EBAY) with
    a bearish divergence in August-October. The stock moved to new highs in September-October,
    but RSI formed lower highs for the bearish divergence. The subsequent breakdown
    in mid October confirmed weakening momentum.

    with eBay moving to new lows in March and RSI holding above its prior low. RSI
    reflected less downside momentum during the February-March decline. The mid-March
    breakout confirmed improving momentum. Divergences tend to be more robust when
    they form after an overbought or oversold reading.

    be noted that divergences are misleading in a strong trend. A strong uptrend can
    show numerous bearish divergences before a top actually materializes. Conversely,
    bullish divergences can appear in a strong downtrend - and yet the downtrend continues.
    Chart 6 shows the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) with three bearish divergences and a continuing
    uptrend. These bearish divergences may have warned of a short-term pullback, but
    there was clearly no major trend reversal.

    reversal. Failure swings are independent of price action. In other words, failure
    swings focus solely on RSI for signals and ignore the concept of divergences.
    A bullish failure swing forms when RSI moves below 30 (oversold), bounces above
    30, pulls back, holds above 30 and then breaks its prior high. It is basically
    a move to oversold levels and then a higher low above oversold levels. Chart 7

    that oscillators do not travel between 0 and 100\. This also happens to be the
    name of the first chapter. Brown identifies a bull market range and a bear market
    for RSI. RSI tends to fluctuate between 40 and 90 in a bull market (uptrend) with
    the 40-50 zones acting as support. These ranges may vary depending on RSI parameters,
    strength of trend and volatility of the underlying security. Chart 9 shows 14-week
    RSI for SPY during the bull market from 2003 until 2007\. RSI surged above 70
    in late 2003 and then moved into its bull market range (40-90). There was one
    overshoot below 40 in July 2004, but RSI held the 40-50 zone at least five times
    from January 2005 until October 2007 (green arrows). In fact, notice that pullbacks
    to this zone provided low risk entry points to participate in the uptrend.

    Cardwell for her RSI enlightenment. Before discussing the reversal technique,
    it should be noted that Cardwell's interpretation of divergences differs from
    Wilder. Cardwell considered bearish divergences as bull market phenomenon. In
    other words, bearish divergences are more likely to form in uptrends. Similarly,
    bullish divergences are considered bear market phenomenon indicative of a downtrend.

    2009\. MMM broke resistance a few weeks later and RSI moved above 70\. Despite

    a lower high as RSI forms a higher high. Even though RSI forged a new high and
    momentum was strong, the price action failed to confirm as lower high formed.

    changes in [volatility](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:standard_deviation_volatility
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:standard_deviation_volatility") and the markets
    over the years, RSI remains as relevant now as it was in Wilder's days. While
    Wilder's original interpretations are useful to understanding the indicator, the
    work of Brown and Cardwell takes RSI interpretation to a new level. Adjusting
    to this level takes some rethinking on the part of the traditionally schooled
    chartists. Wilder considers overbought conditions ripe for a reversal, but overbought
    can also be a sign of strength. Bearish divergences still produce some good sell
    signals, but chartists must be careful in strong trends when bearish divergences
    are actually normal. Even though the concept of positive and negative reversals
    may seem to undermine Wilder's interpretation, the logic makes sense and Wilder
    would hardly dismiss the value of putting more emphasis on price action. Positive
    and negative reversals put price action of the underlying security first and the
    indicator second, which is the way it should be. Bearish and bullish divergences
    place the indicator first and price action second. By putting more emphasis on
    price action, the concept of positive and negative reversals challenges our thinking
    towards momentum oscillators.
