  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The binomial tree model offers a discrete yet powerful method for valuing options,
    where the price of the underlying asset is assumed to follow a binomial distribution
    — moving either up or down with certain probabilities at each step until the option's
    expiration. This lattice-based approach provides a flexible framework for pricing
    American options, which can be exercised at any time before expiration, as well
    as European options, which can only be exercised at maturity.

    of an initial asset price and a series of time intervals leading up to the option''s
    maturity. At each node within the tree, the asset price can move to one of two
    possible new values in the next time step: an ''up'' movement or a ''down'' movement.
    These movements are defined by the ''up'' factor (u) and the ''down'' factor (d),
    calculated using the volatility of the asset and the time interval of each step.'

    we can discount the expected payoffs of the option at the risk-free rate. Under
    this assumption, we calculate the risk-neutral probabilities (p and 1-p) for the
    asset's upward and downward movements, respectively.

    of the option (the difference between the stock price and the strike price for
    in-the-money options). We then move backward through the tree, discounting these
    payoffs at the risk-free rate and weighting them by the risk-neutral probabilities
    to calculate the option value at the preceding nodes. For American options, we
    also consider the possibility of early exercise at each node, which adds a comparison
