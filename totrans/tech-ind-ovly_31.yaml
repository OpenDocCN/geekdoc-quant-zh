    behind a move or identify possible turning points. Developed by Alexander Elder,
    the Force Index was introduced in his classic book, *[Trading for a Living](http://store.stockcharts.com/products/the-new-trading-for-a-living
    "http://store.stockcharts.com/products/the-new-trading-for-a-living")*. According
    to Elder, there are three essential elements to a stock''s price movement: direction,
    extent and volume. The Force Index combines all three as an oscillator that fluctuates
    in positive and negative territory as the balance of power shifts. The Force Index
    can be used to reinforce the overall trend, identify playable corrections or foreshadow
    reversals with divergences.'

    the prior close from the current close and multiply by volume. The Force Index
    for more than one day is simply an exponential [moving average](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_averages
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_averages") of the 1-period Force Index.
    For example, a 13-period Force Index is a 13-period EMA of the 1-period Force
    Index values for the last 13 periods.

- en: Three factors affect Force Index values. First, the Force Index is positive
    when the current close is above the prior close. The Force Index is negative when
    the current close is below the prior close. Second, the extent of the move determines
    the volume multiplier. Bigger moves warrant larger multipliers that influence
    the Force Index accordingly. Small moves produce small multipliers that reduce
    the influence. Third, volume plays a key role. A big move on big volume produces
    a high Force Index values. Small moves on low volume produce relatively low Force
    Index values. The table below shows the Force Index calculations for Pfizer (PFE).
    Line 27 marks the biggest move (+84 cents) and the biggest volume (162,619). This
    combination produces the biggest Force Index value on the table (136,600).

    Index fluctuates above/below the zero line and looks quite jagged. Elder recommends
    smoothing the indicator with a 13-period EMA to reduce the positive-negative crossovers.
    Chartists should experiment with different smoothing periods to determine what
    best suits their analytical needs.

- en: As noted above, there are three elements to the Force Index. First, there is
    either a positive or negative price change. A positive price change signals that
    buyers were stronger than sellers, while a negative price change signals that
    sellers were stronger than buyers. Second, there is the extent of the price change,
    which is simply the current close less the prior close. The “extent” shows us
    just how far prices moved. A big advance shows strong buying pressure, while a
    big decline shows strong selling pressure. The third and final element is volume,
    which, according to Elder, measures commitment. Just how committed are the buyers
    and sellers? A big advance on heavy volume shows a strong commitment from buyers.
    Likewise, a big decline on heavy volume shows a strong commitment from sellers.
    The Force Index quantifies these three elements into one indicator that measures
    buying and selling pressure.

- en: The Force Index can be used to reinforce or determine the [trend](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:chart_analysis:trend_lines
    "chart_school:chart_analysis:trend_lines"). The trend in question, short-term,
    medium-term or long-term, depends on the Force Index parameters. While the default
    Force Index parameter is 13, chartists can use a higher number for more smoothing
    or a lower number for less smoothing. The chart below shows Home Depot with a
    100-day Force Index and a 13-day Force Index. Notice how the 13-day Force Index
    is more volatile and jagged. The 100-day Force Index is smoother and crosses the
    zero line fewer times. In this regard, the 100-day Force Index can be used to
    determine the medium or long-term trend. Notice how a resistance breakout on the
    price chart corresponds to a resistance breakout on the 100-day Force Index. The
    100-day Force Index moved into positive territory and broke resistance in mid-February.
    The indicator remained positive during the entire uptrend and turned negative
    in mid-May. The early June support break on the price chart was confirmed with
    a support break in the Force Index.

- en: Bullish and [bearish divergences](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:glossary_b#bearish_divergence
    "chart_school:glossary_b") can alert chartists of a potential trend change. Divergences
    are classic signals associated with oscillators. A bullish divergence forms when
    the indicator moves higher as the security moves lower. The indicator is not confirming
    weakness in price and this can foreshadow a bullish trend reversal. A bearish
    divergence forms when the indicator moves lower as the security moves higher.
    Even though the security is moving higher, the indicator shows underlying weakness
    by moving lower. This discrepancy can foreshadow a bearish trend reversal.

- en: Confirmation is an important part of bullish and bearish divergences. Even though
    the divergences signal something is amiss, confirmation from the indicator or
    price chart is needed. A bullish divergence can be confirmed with the Force Index
    moving into positive territory or a resistance breakout on the price chart. A
    bearish divergence can be confirmed with the Force Index moving into negative
    territory or a support break on the price chart. Chartists can also use candlesticks,
    moving average crosses, pattern breaks and other forms of technical analysis for
    confirmation.

    of divergences. The green lines show bullish divergences, while the red lines
    show bearish divergences. A bullish divergence is confirmed when the Force Index
    (39) crosses into positive territory (green dotted lines). A bearish divergence
    is confirmed when the Force Index (39) crosses into negative territory (red dotted
    lines). Chartists can also use trendline breaks on the price chart for confirmation.

    short-term fluctuations and is more sensitive. The Force Index (39) captures medium-term
    fluctuations and is smoother. The 39-day Force Index produces fewer zero line
    crossovers and these crossovers last longer. There is no right or wrong answer
    for these settings. It depends on trading objectives, time horizon, and analytical
    style.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Force Index can be used in conjunction with a trend following indicator
    to identify short-term corrections within that trend. A pullback from [overbought](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:glossary_o#overbought
    "chart_school:glossary_o") levels represents a short-term correction within an
    uptrend. An oversold bounce represents a short-term correction within a downtrend.
    Yes, corrections can be up or down, it depends on the direction of the bigger
    trend. Alexander Elder recommends using a 22-day EMA for trend identification
    and a 2-day Force Index to identify corrections. The trend is up when the 22-day
    EMA is moving higher, which means the 2-day Force Index would be used to identify
    short-term pullbacks for buying. The trend is down when the 22-day EMA is moving
    lower, which means the 2-day Force Index would be used to identify short-term
    bounces for selling. This is an aggressive strategy best suiting for active traders.
    The timeframe can be adjusted by using a longer moving average and timeframe for
    the Force Index. For example, medium-term traders might experiment with a 100-day
    EMA and 10-day Force Index.

    either act as soon as the correction is evident or act when there is evidence
    the correction has ended. Let's look at an example with the 22-day EMA and 2-day
    Force Index. Keep in mind that this is designed to identify very short corrections
    within a bigger trend. The chart below shows Texas Instruments (TXN) with the
    22-day EMA turning up in mid-September.

- en: With the 22-day EMA rising, traders are looking for very short-term pullbacks
    when the 2-day Force Index turns negative. Traders can act when the Force Index
    turns negative or wait for it to move back into positive territory. Acting when
    negative may improve the reward-to-risk ratio, but the correction could extend
    a few more days. Waiting for the Force Index to turn positive again shows some
    strength that could signal the correction has ended. The green dotted lines show
    when the 2-day Force Index turns negative.

    The price portion covers the trend, while the volume portion determines the intensity.
    At its most basic, chartists can use a long-term Force Index to confirm the underlying
    trend. The bulls have the edge when the 100-day Force Index is positive. The bears
    have the edge when the 100-day Force Index is negative. Armed with this information,
    traders can then look for short-term setups in harmony with the larger trend,
    such as bullish setups in a larger uptrend or bearish setups within a larger downtrend.
    As with all indicators, traders should use the Force Index in conjunction with
    other [indicators](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators "chart_school:technical_indicators")
    and [analysis techniques](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:chart_analysis:chart_patterns

    users can place the indicator above, below or behind the underlying price plot.
    Placing the Force Index directly on top of the price plot accentuates the movements
    relative to price action of the underlying security. This can make it easier to
    identify bullish and bearish divergences. Chartists can click “advanced options”
    to add a moving average, horizontal line, or another indicator to the Force Index.
