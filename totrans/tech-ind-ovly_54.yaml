- en: Developed by Larry Williams in 1976 and featured in Stocks & Commodities Magazine
    in 1985, the Ultimate Oscillator is a momentum oscillator designed to capture
    momentum across three different timeframes. The multiple timeframe objective seeks
    to avoid the pitfalls of other oscillators. Many [momentum oscillators](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:introduction_to_technical_indicators_and_oscillators#momentum_oscillators
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:introduction_to_technical_indicators_and_oscillators")
    surge at the beginning of a strong advance and then form a bearish divergence
    as the advance continues. This is because they are stuck with one timeframe. The
    Ultimate Oscillator attempts to correct this fault by incorporating longer timeframes
    into the basic formula. Williams identified a buy signal a based on a bullish
    divergence and a sell signal based on a bearish divergence.

- en: There are quite a few steps involved in the Ultimate Oscillator (UO) calculation.
    This example is based on the default settings (7,14,28). First, calculate Buying
    Pressure (BP) to determine the overall direction of price action. Second, measure
    Buying Pressure relative to the True Range (TR). This tells us the true magnitude
    of a gain or loss. Third, create averages based on the three timeframes involved
    (7,14,28). Fourth, create a weighted average of the three averages.

    current low or prior close, whichever is the lowest. True Range (TR) measures
    the price range from the current high or prior close (whichever is highest) to
    the current low or prior close (whichever is lowest). Both Buying Pressure and
    True Range incorporate the prior close to account for possible gaps from one period
    to the next. Buying Pressure is then shown relative to the True Range by dividing
    the X-period sum of BP by the X-period Sum of True Range. Averages are created
    for 7, 14 and 28 periods. These numbers correspond with the default parameters.
    A weighted mean is then created by multiplying the shortest Average by 4, the
    middle Average by 2 and the longest Average by 1\. These weighted amounts are
    then summed and divided by the sum of the weightings (4+2+1).

  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Buying Pressure and its relationship to the True Range forms the base for the
    Ultimate Oscillator. Williams believes that the best way to measure Buying Pressure
    is simply subtracting the Close from the Low or the Prior Close, whichever of
    the two is the lowest. This will reflect the true magnitude of the advance, and
    hence, buying pressure. The Ultimate Oscillator rises when Buying Pressure is
    strong and falls when Buying Pressure is weak.

- en: The Ultimate Oscillator measures momentum for three distinct timeframes. Notice
    that the second timeframe is double that of the first, and the third timeframe
    is double that of the second. Even though the shortest timeframe carries the most
    weight, the longest timeframe is not ignored and this should reduce the number
    of false divergences. This is important because the basic buy signal is based
    on a bullish divergence and the basic sell signal is based on a bearish divergence.

    "chart_school:glossary_b") forms between the indicator and security price. This
    means the Ultimate Oscillator forms a higher low as price forges a lower low.
    The higher low in the oscillator shows less downside momentum. Second, the low
    of the bullish divergence should be below 30\. This is to ensure that prices are
    somewhat oversold or at a relative extremity. Third, the oscillator rises above
    the high of the bullish divergence.

    in late June and forming a large bullish divergence with a higher low in late
    August. Technically, the indicator did not confirm the divergence until mid-September.
    Technical analysis, however, requires a little flexibility. Chartists could have
    used the move above 50 as a trigger for the Ultimate Oscillator instead. This
    centerline acts as a bull-bear threshold for the indicator. The cup is half full
    (bullish bias) when above and half empty (bearish bias) when below. Also notice
    that the stock broke the June trend line and surged above short-term resistance
    in early September for further confirmation.

    signal. The Ultimate Oscillator moved to oversold levels (<30) as the stock fell
    in early June. While the stock moved to new lows in late June, the indicator held
    above its prior low and above 30\. The subsequent break above the intermittent
    high confirmed the bullish divergence signal. Also notice that AEO broke above
    resistance with a four-day surge. Even those who missed the breakout got a second
    chance as the stock pulled back in August and again broke resistance.

    somewhat overbought or at a relative extremity. Third, the oscillator falls below

    failed to confirm this high and formed a lower high. Also, notice that the indicator
    became overbought in mid-April. The subsequent break below the divergence low
    in late April confirmed the bearish signal. CAT broke trend line support two days
    later and declined sharply into early June.

    a confirmed signal. The Ultimate Oscillator became overbought in the latter part
    of April. As the stock moved to new highs, the indicator forged lower highs in
    mid-May and again in late June. A bearish divergence was working in mid-May, but
    the indicator never broke its divergence low for confirmation. After a bigger
    divergence formed, the indicator broke its divergence low at the end of June to
    foreshadow a rather sharp decline.

    It is sometimes necessary to adjust the parameters to generate overbought or oversold
    readings, which are part of the buy and sell signals. Relatively docile stocks
    or securities may not generate overbought or oversold readings with the default
    parameters (7,14,28). Chartists need to increase sensitivity with shorter timeframes.
    The chart for Boeing (BA) shows the Ultimate Oscillator (7,14,28) trading between
    30 and 70 for six months. There were no overbought or oversold readings. Shortening
    the timeframe to (4,8,16) increased sensitivity and generated at least six overbought
    or oversold readings. The opposite is true for securities with high volatility.
    It is sometimes necessary to lengthen the timeframes to reduce sensitivity and
    the number of signals.

- en: The Ultimate Oscillator is a momentum oscillator that incorporates three different
    timeframes. Traditional signals are derived from bullish and bearish divergence,
    but chartists can also look at actual levels for a trading bias. This usually
    works better with longer parameters and longer trends. For example, the Ultimate
    Oscillator (20,40,80) and price trend favors the bulls when above 50 and the bears
    when below 50\. As with all indicators, the Ultimate Oscillator should not be
    used alone. Complementary indicators, [chart patterns](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:chart_analysis:chart_patterns
    "chart_school:chart_analysis:chart_patterns") and other analysis tools should
    be employed to confirm signals.
