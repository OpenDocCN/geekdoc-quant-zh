- en: Volume-by-Price is an indicator that shows the amount of volume for a particular
    price range, which is based on closing prices. The Volume-by-Price bars are horizontal
    and shown on the left side of the chart to correspond with these price ranges.
    Chartists can view these bars as a single color or with two colors to separate
    up volume and down volume. By combining volume and closing prices, this indicator
    can be used to identify high-volume price ranges to mark support or resistance.
    StockCharts shows twelve Volume-by-Price bars by default, but users can increase
    or decrease this number to suit their preferences.

    chart. Volume-by-Price on a five-month daily chart would be based on **ALL** five
    months of daily closing data. Volume-by-Price on a two-week 30-minute chart would
    be based on two weeks of 30-minute closing data. Volume-by-Price on a three-year
    weekly chart would be based on three years of weekly closing data. You get the
    idea. Volume-by-Price calculations do not extend beyond the historical data shown
    on the chart.

    ETF from April 12th until September 15th, 2010\. Closing prices ranged from 40.32
    to 47.87 during this period (47.87 – 40.32 = 7.55). The one hundred and ten closing
    prices (one for each trading day) were sorted from low to high and then divided
    into 12 even price zones (7.55/12 = .6292).

    to 41.58 and 41.59 to 42.21). Starting from the low (40.32), we can add the zone
    size (.6292) to create the price zones leading to the high. Only prices that fall
    within these zones are used for that particular Volume-by-Price calculation.

    can then be separated into positive and negative volume. Notice that the Volume-by-Price
    bars on the chart above are red and green to separate positive volume from negative
    volume.

    "chart_school:chart_analysis:support_and_resistance") levels as well as estimate
    future support and resistance levels. Price zones with heavy volume reflect elevated
    interest levels that can influence future supply or demand (a.k.a. resistance
    or support). Long Volume-by-Price bars underneath prices should be watched as
    potential support during a pullback. Similarly, long Volume-by-Price bars above
    prices should be watched as potential resistance on a bounce.

    A break above a long bar shows strength because demand was strong enough to overcome
    a supply overhang. Similarly, a break below a long bar shows weakness because
    supply was ample enough to overwhelm demand.

    works. Volume-by-Price can be used to identify current support or resistance.
    Current bars **should not be used to validate past support or resistance levels**
    because the indicator is based on all the price-volume data shown on the chart.
    This means six months of data for a chart that extends from January to June. Bars
    may appear to identify support in March, but keep in mind that the indicator data
    extends well beyond March because the chart ends in June.

    This makes sense because Volume-by-Price equals zero when there are no closing
    prices within a specific price zone.

    95-100 at the end of June. Notice that this is the longest bar. Also, notice that
    NFLX is beginning a pullback so we can use Volume-by-Price to estimate support
    in the near future. The second chart shows NFLX with the yellow area marking Volume-by-Price
    support from the first chart. Support was expected in the 95-100 area and the
    stock reversed here in late July. Notice that volume surged in August to validate
    the reversal off of support.

    around 26-26.5 in early August. Remember, the April break above this bar is not
    really a breakout because the current Volume-by-Price calculation extends from
    January to early August. The second longest bar marks current resistance in the
    26-26.5 area. TEL is at its make-or-break point with prices near resistance. The
    second chart shows Volume-by-Price resistance from the first and the ultimate
    failure at resistance.

    pressure that can foreshadow lower prices. Long bars below prices show elevated
    interest areas and potential support. A break below this support zone signals
    a significant increase in selling pressure and lower prices are then expected.

    the 39-43 area in mid-August. Also, notice that the stock forged at least three
    reaction lows around 42 from early July to mid-August. This support (demand) zone
    is clearly marked. The second chart shows SNDK breaking below the previously identified
    Volume-by-Price support zone with high volume. Demand crumbled, supply won the
    day and prices moved sharply lower.

    support zones and resistance zones. The McDonalds (MCD) chart shows a long bar
    marking overhead supply between 60 and 61\. The stock also met resistance between
    61 and 62 with reaction highs in late April and mid-June. For support, the second
    and third longest bars mark potential demand in the 57.5-58.5 area and the stock
    is near the late May low. Overall, a large [Symmetrical Triangle](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:chart_analysis:chart_patterns:symmetrical_triangle_continuation

    The second chart shows MCD breaking resistance in July and surging to new highs
    in August.

    resistance. The indicator marks potential support when prices are above a long
    bar and potential resistance when prices are below a long bar. Chartists can enhance
    their analysis by looking at the positive (green) and negative (red) volume within
    the Volume-by-Price bars. Long green portions reflect more demand that can further
    validate support. Long red portions reflect more supply that can further validate
    resistance. It is important to confirm Volume-by-Price findings with other indicators
    and analysis techniques. [Momentum oscillators](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:introduction_to_technical_indicators_and_oscillators#momentum_oscillators

    and [chart patterns](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:chart_analysis:chart_patterns
    "chart_school:chart_analysis:chart_patterns") are good complements to this volume

    box is empty and this means the default is used (12 periods). Chartists can increase
    or decrease the default setting depending on the amount of detail desired. Keep
    in mind that Volume-by-Price is based on closing prices, which means highs and
    lows are not included. This is why chartists may sometimes see a spike low or
    high without a Volume-by-Price bar. Volume-by-Price is one color when the “color
    volume” box is not checked and two-toned when this box is checked. Chartists can
    also use the advanced indicator settings to set the opacity. The example below
    shows Apple with 20-bar Volume-by-Price, colored volume, and 0.3 opacity. [Click
