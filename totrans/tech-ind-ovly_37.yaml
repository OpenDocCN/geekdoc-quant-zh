- en: On Balance Volume (OBV) measures buying and selling pressure as a cumulative
    indicator that adds volume on up days and subtracts volume on down days. OBV was
    developed by Joe Granville and introduced in his 1963 book, Granville's New Key
    to Stock Market Profits. It was one of the first indicators to measure positive
    and negative volume flow. Chartists can look for divergences between OBV and price
    to predict price movements or use OBV to confirm price trends.

- en: The On Balance Volume (OBV) line is simply a running total of positive and negative
    volume. A period's volume is positive when the close is above the prior close.
    A period's volume is negative when the close is below the prior close.

- en: Data in the table above comes from Wal-mart (WMT). Volume figures were rounded
    off and are shown in 1000's. In other words, 8,200 really equals 8,200,000 or
    8.2 million shares. First, we must determine if Wal-mart closed up (+1) or down
    (-1). This number is now used as the volume multiplier to compute positive or
    negative volume. The last column (OBV) forms the running total for positive/negative
    volume. Because OBV has to start somewhere, the first value (8200) is simply equal
    to the first period's positive/negative volume. The chart below shows Wal-mart
    with volume and OBV.

- en: Granville theorized that volume precedes price. OBV rises when volume on up
    days outpaces volume on down days. OBV falls when volume on down days is stronger.
    A rising OBV reflects positive volume pressure that can lead to higher prices.
    Conversely, falling OBV reflects negative volume pressure that can foreshadow
    lower prices. Granville noted in his research that OBV would often move before
    price. Expect prices to move higher if OBV is rising while prices are either flat
    or moving down. Expect prices to move lower if OBV is falling while prices are
    either flat or moving up.

- en: The absolute value of OBV is not important. Chartists should instead focus on
    the characteristics of the OBV line. First, define the trend for OBV. Second,
    determine if the current trend matches the trend for the underlying security.
    Third, look for potential support or resistance levels. Once broken, the trend
    for OBV will change and these breaks can be used to generate signals. Also, notice
    that OBV is based on closing prices. Therefore, closing prices should be considered
    when looking for divergences or support/resistance breaks. And finally, volume
    spikes can sometimes throw off the indicator by causing a sharp move that will
    require a settling period.

    "chart_school:glossary_b") signals can be used to anticipate a trend reversal.
    These signals are truly based on the theory that volume precedes prices. A bullish
    divergence forms when OBV moves higher or forms a higher low even as prices move
    lower or forge a lower low. A bearish divergence forms when OBV moves lower or
    forms a lower low even as prices move higher or forge a higher high. The divergence
    between OBV and price should alert chartists that a price reversal could be in
    the making.

    "chart_school:glossary_b") forming in July. On the price chart, SBUX moved below
    its June low with a lower low in early July. OBV, on the other hand, held above
    its June low to form a bullish divergence. OBV went on to break resistance before
    SBUX broke resistance. This was a classic case of volume leading price. SBUX broke
    resistance a week later and continued above 20 for a 30+ percent gain. The second
    chart shows OBV moving higher as Texas Instruments (TXN) trades within a range.
    Rising OBV during a trading range indicates accumulation, which is bullish.

    price lower. The blue dotted lines identify the divergence period. MDT moved higher
    (43 to 45) as OBV moved lower. Also, notice that OBV broke support during this
    divergence period. The uptrend in OBV reversed with the break below the February
    low. MDT, on the other hand, was still moving higher. Volume ultimately won the
    day as MDT followed volume lower with a decline into the low 30s. The second chart
    shows Valero Energy (VLO) with OBV forming a bearish divergence in April and a
    confirming support break in May.

    of the price trend. OBV and BBY moved lower in December-January, higher from March
    to April, lower from May to August and higher from September to October. The trends

    line in late February and OBV confirmed with a resistance breakout in March. BBY
    broke its uptrend line in late April and OBV confirmed with a support break in
    early May. BBY broke its downtrend line in early September and OBV confirmed with
    a trend line break a week later. These coincident signals indicated that positive
    and negative volume were in harmony with price.

    OBV is confirming the strength of the underlying trend, be it down or up. The
    chart for Autozone (AZO) shows prices as a black line and OBV as a pink line.
    Both moved steadily higher from November 2009 until October 2010\. Positive volume
    remained strong throughout the advance.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On Balance Volume (OBV) is a simple indicator that uses volume and price to
    measure buying pressure and selling pressure. Buying pressure is evident when
    positive volume exceeds negative volume and the OBV line rises. Selling pressure
    is present when negative volume exceeds positive volume and the OBV line falls.
    Chartists can use OBV to confirm the underlying trend or look for divergences
    that may foreshadow a price change. As with all indicators, it is important to
    use OBV in conjunction with other aspects of technical analysis. It is not a standalone
    indicator. OBV can be combined with basic [pattern analysis](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:chart_analysis:chart_patterns
    "chart_school:chart_analysis:chart_patterns") or to confirm signals from [momentum
    oscillators](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:introduction_to_technical_indicators_and_oscillators#momentum_oscillators

    OBV can be positioned above, below or behind the price plot of the underlying
    security. Positioning it behind the plot makes it easy to compare OBV with the
    underlying security. Chartists can also add a [moving average](/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_averages
    "chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_averages") or another indicator to OBV
    by selecting Advanced options, which is to the right of the indicator position.
