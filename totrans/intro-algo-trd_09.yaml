- en: Once you have a trading platform selected, it is time to get to work!  Before
    you can start creating and trading your algos, there are some specific platform
    tasks you need to master.  Here is how I would do it, in the order I would recommend
    for you.

- en: Starting out with a new trading platform, whichever one it is, will certainly
    be a daunting task.  You will need help.  Luckily, if you choose one of the top
    platforms detailed in the previous chapter, you will find help in all sorts of
    places.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first source of help should be the software vendor itself.   They have trained
    people to answer most questions, especially for beginners.  As you progress in
    your knowledge, though, you’ll realize that other users are sometimes a better
    source of information.  In the beginning, though, the vendor or their online help
    files and videos should be a first resort.

- en: Once important thing to remember with vendor help – if it is a trade specific
    issue (missed order, bad fill, etc) you should always call the Trade Desk at your
    broker first.  They are always the best source of information for specific trade
    details of your account.  They might refer you to technical support, but when
    I have an issue and am unsure of my current position, I first call the Trade Desk.

- en: Sometimes the vendor can’t answer your question, or can’t spend the time with
    you that you need.  Luckily, there are 3rd party sources of technical assistance. 
    For example, YouTube has a ton of useful videos for Tradestation.  Many of these
    outside sources provide free information, along with paid services.

- en: I think the true experts are the software users who are also traders.  Make
    sure you know how to contact these people.  Usually they can be found on trading
    forums like futures.io or elitetrader.com.  Also, every software vendor has a
    user forum, where the best answers might come from experienced users and traders. 
    I use Tradestation’s user forum quite a bit, and I still ask questions to this
    day, some 14 years after I started using the software.  The learning never ends!

    day you start up your new trading software.  Take some time, learn the basics,
    get a feel for how things are set up and how they work.

    software?  I have with my three kids, and I can say, they are absolutely fearless. 
    They will click on anything and everything, knowing they can usually shut the
    software down and start it up again fresh.

    it, apply some canned strategies to the chart, and take a look at the resulting
    performance report.  Explore and play – you will learn more quickly that way.

    learn how to do it!  Start by learning the basic structure of the programming
    language – if…then statements, buy and sell order syntax, etc.

    Most also have paid services, like introductory programming “boot camps.”  There
    are also plenty of third party companies with both free and paid programming tips.

    the place of actually programming and practicing on your own.

- en: Take a look at any strategies supplied with the software.  Figure out what each
    line does, and how it is written.  Make a copy of the strategy, and then modify
    the copy.  Make small changes at first, and then progressively attempt more complicated
    changes.

    That might take a few days, weeks or even months, but that is where you eventually
    want to be – where you can easily modify existing strategies, and create your
    own new strategies.

- en: One major topic your software will not help you with is developing strategies
    in a proper manner.  It is not as simple as applying a strategy to a chart, running
    a lot of optimization and then live trading the best overall optimized result. 
    In fact, that is the exact WRONG thing to do, even though the software makes it
    so easy.
  prefs: []

- en: Correct strategy development and evaluation is a big topic, and there are very
    good books out there on proper strategy development.  Books by Pardo, Tomasini
    and Davey are among the best for learning proper strategy development processes,
    in my opinion.  I recommend you get a couple or all of these books, and incorporate
    their lessons into how you develop strategies.

    I use Tradestation for my example, you should be able to replicate each of the
    steps in your platform.  Once you can easily do all these steps, you are in good
    position to begin creating your own trading algos.

- en: The last task in learning your software is learning how to fool it.  Almost
    every trading platform can be “gamed.”  That is, there are coding tricks and software
    settings that produce phenomenal equity curves.  An example is below.  I created
    this strategy in 1 minute.  Looks perfect to trade, doesn’t it?  One slight problem,
    though – it is fake, and the results are based on exploiting the trading software
    backtest engine.
